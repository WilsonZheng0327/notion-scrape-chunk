# Manage members & guests

Note:If you're on the Enterprise plan, the images in this article might look a little different from what you see in Notion. Thanks for your understanding!

Learn more about different types of people in a workspace
- Whos who in a workspace
- Who should be a workspace member, and who should be a guest?

## Add a member

Note:On paid plans, you'll be charged per member in your workspace. For more information on plans,go here

##########################################

### With email
To add a member using their email:
- Go toSettingsPeopleorMembers(depending on your plan).
- Go to theMemberstab.
- SelectAdd membersand type the email address of the person you want to add. If you don't have invite access, you will instead have the option to request to add a member.
- Select whether to add them as aWorkspace owner,Membership admin,orMemberfrom the dropdown, then pressInvite.
- They'll receive an email with a link to sign in and join your workspace.

##########################################

### Using a link
To add a member via a link:
- Go toSettingsPeopleorMembers(depending on your plan).
- Go to theMemberstab.
- SelectCopy linkto copy the secret link to your clipboard, and share with anyone youd like to invite to work with you.
- When an invited user clicks on the secret link, they'll be able to join your workspace automatically as a paid member, without you having to add their email address manually.
- If you dont want to be able to invite people to your workspace with a link, turn off the toggle next toInvite link.

##########################################

### With an allowed domain
If you're using Notion at your company, you can make it easy for anyone to automatically join your workspace as a member when they sign in with their work email. To set this up, workspace owners can:
- Go toSettingsSettings.
- UnderAllowed email domains, enter any email domain that you want to grant access to automatically, like your company's email domain. You can add multiple allowed domains in this field, but you'll only be able to add domains that workspace members' accounts are under.

##########################################

Now, whenever someone signs into Notion with an email that has one of those domains, they'll see the option to join your workspace during onboarding. If the user joins your workspace, they will become a member of your workspace and you will be billed accordingly.
### Change a member's role
To change a member's role in the workspace:
- Go toSettingsPeopleorMembers(depending on your plan).
- Go to theMemberstab.
- Select the dropdown for a members role, then selectWorkspace owner,Membership admin, orMember.
## Add a guest

Learn about the difference between guests and membershere

##########################################

### From a page
Remember that guests can be added to individual pages, not to an entire workspace. To share a page with a guest:
- Go to Share at the top right of the page.
- Enter the email address of the guest you want to invite.
- Select a level of access for that guest from the dropdown and pressInvite.
- SelectSkip for nowto make sure youre adding them as a guest and not a member.
Your guest will receive an email with a link to the page. If they don't already use Notion, theyll need to sign up to access your page.

##########################################

Note:
- If youre not able to share a page with a guest, this might be because:Your workspace has reached its guest limit.Your workspace or teamspace has prevented guests from being added to the page.The email domain of the guest youre trying to share the page with is not an allowed email domain for your workspace.
* Your workspace has reached its guest limit.
* Your workspace or teamspace has prevented guests from being added to the page.
* The email domain of the guest youre trying to share the page with is not an allowed email domain for your workspace.
- If youre on an Enterprise plan and the owner has prevented members from inviting guests to pages, then any people you invite to a page will automatically be added as members. Before you selectInvitein the steps above, you can hover over your guests name or email for more information on how that person will be added to the page.

##########################################

### From a guest's request
To make it easier for you to add guests to your workspace, Notion also allows people outside of your workspace to request access to certain pages in your workspace. This feature is available and turned on by default for all plans except Enterprise.
If youre on a Plus or Business Plan, you can turn this setting off. Unfortunately, Free plans will not be able to turn this feature off. To do this:
- OpenSettingsSecurity.
- Toggle offAllow page access requests from non-members.
Once the guest submits a request to access a page, a notification will be sent to the inbox of the pages creator. The page creator can approve the request as well as adjust the level of access for that guest, or they can ignore the request.

##########################################

Note:When you add someone to a page, they can automatically access all of its sub-pages by default. That being said, you can restrict or expand sub-page permissions!
## Request to add a guest
Members of a workspace can request to add guests to it. This feature is available on Enterprise Plans only, and only workspace owners can enable or disable it.
### Enable guest requests
To allow members to request adding guests to workspace pages, workspace owners can:
- Go toSettingsSecurity.
- Make sureDisable members inviting guests to pagesis turned on, then turn onAllow members to request adding guests. Workspace owners canDisable guestswithout removing existing guests from the workspace. They still have the option to remove all existing guests if desired.

##########################################

Once this is turned on, members will have to submit a request before they can invite a guest. Workspace owners are exempt and can continue to invite guests directly.

Note:Allow members to request adding guestsis a workspace level setting, and will override the any teamspace level guest setting. This means if a teamspace allows guests, but the workspace has enabled guest requests, members will have to submit guest invite requests to add guests to pages in the teamspace.
### Request to invite a guest
If you're a workspace owner,you caninvite guests directly.

##########################################

If you're a member:
- Navigate to the page you want to invite a guest to. Just like with regular sharing, you must have full access permissions on the page to request to invite a guest.
- SelectShareand type the name of the guest you want to invite.
- Select the role you want the guest to have.
- SelectInvite.
- A notification will be sent to your workspace owner about your request, along with the page, role and email of the guest you requested. You will also receive confirmation that your workspace owner has been notified.

##########################################

### Approve a guest
Guest invite requests must be approved on a per page, per guest basis.Only workspace owners can view and approve guest requests. Each request will have the email of the guest, the member who requested it, the role that was requested, and the name of the page.
A workspace owner can approve or reject a request to invite a guest directly from the notification they receive, or by going to by going toSettingsMembersGuestsand finding the requests at the top. Once a workspace owner responds to a request, the member who submitted will be notified of the decision.

##########################################

## Turn guests into members
Give any guest the ability to access your entire workspace by turning them into a member.On paid plans, you'll be charged for each additional member. To turn a guest into a member:
- Go toSettingsPeopleorMembers(depending on your plan) Guests.
- Check the box next to the guests you want to upgrade.
- SelectUpgrade {#} guest(s) to member.
- Once they become a member, you can find them in your member list and change their role.
On non-Enterprise Plans, well also suggest some guests who might benefit from becoming members in your workspace. To see who these guests are, go toSettingsMembersSuggestions. You can selectUpgradeto turn someone into a workspace member.

##########################################

## Remove a user
To remove a member or guest from a workspace, a workspace owner or a membership admin can:
- Go toSettingsPeopleorMembers(depending on the plan).
- Go to theMemberstab or theGueststab.
- Depending on the plan and who youre trying to remove:Open the dropdown for a members role, then selectRemove from workspace.Selectnext to a member, then selectRemove from workspace.Open the dropdown for a guests pages, then selectRemove.
* Open the dropdown for a members role, then selectRemove from workspace.
* Selectnext to a member, then selectRemove from workspace.
* Open the dropdown for a guests pages, then selectRemove.

##########################################

Note:
- When you remove a member from a workspace, that person will instantly lose access to the workspace, and pages from thePrivatesection of their left sidebar will be hidden from view. If you invite that member back to the workspace, their private pages will be unhidden.
- If a user has left and rejoined a workspace within the last 30 days, their private pages, shared pages, group membership, and teamspace membership will be restored upon rejoining the workspace.

# Import from Asana
Importing from Asana allows you to move your organizations teams, projects, and tasks in Asana into Notion. Any member on any plan can take advantage of the Asana importer.

Importing from Asana vs. syncing Asana with Notion
Importing your Asana data into Notion is best if you want to move from Asana and use Notion as the primary tool for your work. The data will be duplicated into Notion, but not synchronized with Asana.
Synced databasesallow you to connect Asana to Notion without importing any data. You might prefer to use synced databases if you use both Asana and Notion for your work. Synced databases only go one direction, meaning that changes will need to happen in Asana in order for updates to reflect in Notion.

##########################################

To add a synced database from Asana, simply paste a project link right into a Notion page. Learn more about synced databaseshere

- Import projects from Asana for a connected work experience


## Import from Asana into Notion

##########################################

Note:
- To import your Asana projects to Notion, you must be associated with a team in Asana, even if you're the only person on that team.
- You can only import one Asana workspace into Notion at a time.
- Each Asana team will be imported into one Notion teamspace.
- Multiple projects imported into one teamspace will go into the same Projects and Tasks databases. If you'd like to import into multiple databases, try importing in batches.
- In the import process, there will be some default properties that youll be required to import into Notion from Asana.

##########################################

To import from Asana into Notion:
- Go toSettingsin your sidebar ImportAsana. Alternatively, use the/command/asanain a page and select the option underImport.
- Sign into Asana and grant the requested permissions.
- UnderChoose Asana workspace, select the Asana workspace you want to import.

- SelectImport.

##########################################

## How importing from Asana works
Your selected Asana projects and properties will be imported along with the tasks associated with those selected projects. Asana projects and tasks will be imported into Projects and Tasks databases in Notion, respectively. The Notion Projects and Tasks databases are related to each other, in line with ourProjects & Tasks template.

Your Projects and Tasks databases come with several views to help you see and track your work more easily. Visit the links below to learn about:
- Databases
- Views, filters, and sorts
- Table view, which is theequivalent of Asanas list view
- List view
- Timeline view

##########################################

### How Asana maps to Notion
- Asana projects will become Notion projects.
- Asana tasks will become Notion tasks.
- Asana teams will become Notion teamspaces.
- Asana organizations or workspaces will become Notion workspaces.
## Projects database
Your Asana projects will be imported into a Projects database in Notion. The Asana importer will pre-populate default database views for ease of use. You can add or delete views and properties as needed.

##########################################

These default database views include:
- Active (table view): This view shows the projects youve imported whose status is to-do or in progress. In other words, this view doesnt show projects that have already been completed. There are also preset filters for owner and date to make searching easier.
- Timeline view: This view displays project name, status, owner, and completion rate. There are also preset filters for status, owner, and date to make searching easier.
- Board view: This view shows your projects grouped by status (Planning,Backlog,On Track). You can customize the statuses that show in the view in themenu. Projects are sorted by descending priority.
- All (table view): This view displays all of your imported projects. There are preset filters for status, owner, and date to make searching easier.

##########################################

View project details

* Timeline view: This view displays task name, assignee, and status.
* Calendar view: This view shows your tasks by date and displays assignee and status.

##########################################

## Tasks database
Your Asana tasks will be imported into a Tasks database in Notion. As with the projects database, the Asana importer will pre-populate database views for ease of use. You can add or delete views and properties as needed.
These default database views include:

- Board view: This view displays your tasks, grouped by status and sorted by descending priority. There are pre-set filters for assignee and due date.
- All tasks (table view): This view shows you all of your imported tasks.
- Mine (table view): This view is filtered to only show tasks that are assigned to you.
- Calendar view: This view shows your tasks by date and displays assignee and status.

# Back up your data

Learn more about ourprivacy policyandsecurity practices.
## Export your entire workspace

Note:You must be a workspace admin to do this.
Your Notion data will always be backed up in the cloud, but you can also export it for safekeeping. You can export all your pages as HTML, Markdown, or CSV (for databases), along with any files you've uploaded, too.
If you're on a Business or Enterprise Plan, you can also export your entire workspace to PDF, which can be helpful for legal and compliance backups.

##########################################

Pages that the exporter doesn't have access to, such as private pages of other users, will not be included in the export. Workspace admins on the Enterprise Plan can give themselves and others access to specific pages using content search, so that those pages can be included in future exports. Some content also may not be exported based on teamspace settings.
A sitemap (index.html) is included the export to help you navigate the exported workspace. The list items in the sitemap are locally linked to the exported pages in HTML and Markdown formats.

##########################################

To export your workspace content:
- Go toSettingsin your sidebar General.
- Find and selectExport all workspace content.
- You'll receive an email from Notion with a link to download your files. This link will expire after 7 days.

Note:
- You can only export your entire workspace on desktop or web.
- You cant instantly recreate your workspace by reuploading your exported workspace content.

## Restore from trash

Note:By default, pages will remain in Trash for 30 days before they are automatically removed from Trash. Enterprise plan workspace owners may customize these settings.Learn more here

##########################################

To restore pages, go toTrash, find the page you're looking for, and click on the curved arrow icon next to it. Your page will return to where it was last in your workspace.
## Restore from edit history
You can view and restore past versions of any Notion page going back several days, depending on what plan you're on.Learn more about edit history here
## Accidental deletions
Accidents happen! If you accidentally delete a page, a workspace, or even your entire account, we can help. We keep backups of our database, which allows us to restore a snapshot of any page in the past 30 days if you need it.

# Billing & invoices

- Seeing something unexpected in your invoice? Seebelowfor some common scenarios.
- Be mindful of who you add to your workspace and what kind of role they have. Visitthis articleandour pricing pageto understand how we bill you depending on the users in your workspace and the plan you're on.


Note:The billing policies described in this article may not apply to sales-assisted customers. Please reach out to your account team for more information.
## Notion billing basics

##########################################

### You're billed per member
Notion uses a billing model that charges you based on the number of seats, or licenses, you are using in your workspace. One seat is assigned to each member (not guest) in your workspace. This billing model gives you the flexibility to change which specific people join your Notion workspace as a member, without accruing new charges every time you add a new user.

##########################################

Heres an example:
- Your team is working with three contractors, who have been added as members to your Notion instance. When their contracts are finished, you remove them from your Notion workspace.
- Until the end of your billing period (monthly or annual), you will still have three paid seats in Notion that you can instead fill with new contractors, new hires, interns, or anyone else who you might want to add to your workspace as a member.

Learn more about workspace members and how to manage themhere

##########################################

When youaddmembers to your workspace:
- Regardless of whether you're paying yearly or monthly, our system reviews how many members you've added and issues invoices on a monthly basis.
- You only pay for the fraction of the billing interval that a member belonged to your workspace.
- Because you pay at the beginning of every billing interval, these charges for changes made in the middle of a billing interval are added retroactively to your next invoice.
- On a monthly plan,this means you get your regular monthly invoice billing you for the month ahead (including new members), but the invoice will also include retroactive prorated charges for the members you added during your last billing interval.

##########################################

- On a yearly plan, this means you'll receive an invoice at thenext monthmark (on the same calendar date you bought your plan) that will include two things:The amount due for each new member for the remainder of your year-long plan.Retroactive charges for those new members prorated based on the amount of time they've belonged to your workspace.
* The amount due for each new member for the remainder of your year-long plan.
* Retroactive charges for those new members prorated based on the amount of time they've belonged to your workspace.

##########################################

When youremovemembers from your workspace:
- After removing members,you will still have access to any existing paid seats until the end of your billing interval. You can add new members to fill these seats at no additional charge.
- When your billing interval ends, we will recalculate the total number of paid seats in use in your workspace and bill you accordingly.
Go toSettingsin your sidebar Peopleto view how many paid seats your workspace has, how many members are currently in your workspace, and when you'll be billed next. You can easily manage the members in your workspace here.

##########################################

### We bill you upfront
You always pay for Notion at the start of your billing interval. If you make changes in the middle of a billing interval, we'll prorate how much you're charged, so that you only pay for what you actually used. These prorations will be applied at the start of the next billing interval.
### Every workspace is billed separately
You can create multiple workspaces per account (in other words, per email address you signed up with), in which case you'd receive multiple bills. This is why you might see multiple charges for Notion even if you have only one account.

##########################################

- If you have multiple workspaces, you'll be billed based on how many members you have in each (on a Plus, Business, or Enterprise Plan).
- Even if the same people are in multiple workspaces, you'll be charged for them in each one.
### Your billing interval is set at the workspace level
You could have one workspace billed annually and one billed monthly. You pay less when you choose annual billing. Everyone who joins your workspace will add an additional charge based on the interval of that workspace.
## Yearly vs. monthly billing
You can choose to pay for Notion on a yearly or monthly basis. This impacts both how much you pay and when you pay.

##########################################

- Yearly billing costs less.
- Your plan renews automatically either once a year or once a month.If you pay yearly, your plan will renew on the same calendar day you first purchased it for all following years.If you pay monthly, the same is true of each following month.For example, a yearly plan bought on May 3 will renew May 3 the next year, and a monthly plan renews June 3.
* If you pay yearly, your plan will renew on the same calendar day you first purchased it for all following years.
* If you pay monthly, the same is true of each following month.
* For example, a yearly plan bought on May 3 will renew May 3 the next year, and a monthly plan renews June 3.
- Your bill adjusts for your paid seat count either once a year or once a month.If you pay yearly, the number of licenses you are paying for will be recalculated and reflected in your billingonce a year, on the same calendar date as when you first purchased Notion.This is the only time during the year when your billing will change to reflect any paid seats that have been removed from your workspace.If you pay monthly, this recalculation will occuronce a monthon the same calendar date. Your billing will reflect any paid seats that have been removed from your workspace.When your plan renews, you will only be billed for the number of members currently in the workspace. This means your bill will go down if you have removed members since your last bill, and it will go up if you have added members since your last bill.
* If you pay yearly, the number of licenses you are paying for will be recalculated and reflected in your billingonce a year, on the same calendar date as when you first purchased Notion.
* This is the only time during the year when your billing will change to reflect any paid seats that have been removed from your workspace.
* If you pay monthly, this recalculation will occuronce a monthon the same calendar date. Your billing will reflect any paid seats that have been removed from your workspace.
* When your plan renews, you will only be billed for the number of members currently in the workspace. This means your bill will go down if you have removed members since your last bill, and it will go up if you have added members since your last bill.

##########################################

If you expect your team size to fluctuate often, or youd like more control over your budget, we recommend a monthly billing interval.
## See your plan and billing details

Note:Only workspace owners can view and manage plans and billing.
To view the details of your plan and your billing information:
- Go toSettingsin your sidebar.
- ClickBillingin the sidebar of the pop-up window.
- At the top, you'll see which plan you're on, how much you're paying for it either yearly or monthly, and the date it will renew.

##########################################

## Changing your billing interval
To change your billing interval:
- Go toSettingsin your sidebar.
- ClickBillingin the sidebar of the window that pops up.
- Next to your current billing interval, selectEdit period.
- Youll see your new billing details and an estimate for your next bill. ClickConfirm changesif everything looks good.
### Change from monthly to yearly
When you change from monthly to yearly, you'll establish a new billing cycle, with your plan automatically renewing on the calendar day you made this change the next year.
Whatever amount of time is left on your already paid monthly cycle will be subtracted from your annual payment.

##########################################

For example:
- Let's say youre on the Plus Plan, billed monthly.
- By April 15, you love Notion so much that you switch to a yearly billing interval.
- You already paid for part of the month, so we prorate the price of your yearly plan.
- Since half the month went by, we remove the unused time (the latter half of the month) from your yearly price.
### Change from yearly to monthly
When you change from yearly to monthly, the new monthly billing cycle will take effect the day your annual cycle ends. Your plan will automatically renew each month on the same calendar day going forward.
## View your upcoming invoice
To view your upcoming invoice:
- Go toSettingsin your sidebar.
- SelectBilling.
- UnderInvoices, selectView invoice.

##########################################

## Understanding your invoice
Your invoice might look different from what you expect, and this could be for several reasons:
- You've added or subtracted members from your workspace during the billing interval. Note that when you add new members to your yearly Plus, Business, or Enterprise Plan, you'll be charged foran entire yearof Notion for each of them.
- You changed your billing interval from monthly to yearly, or vice versa.
- You upgraded your plan during a billing interval. In this case, we charge you your previous rate for the time you had that plan, and your new rate for the time you had your upgraded plan. It's a blend of both!
- You've applied credits to your balance due.

##########################################

## Unpaid invoices
If you have one or more invoices that havent been paid yet, you may have limited access to your Notion workspace until the payments are made. For the best experience with Notion, make sure you have the right payment method on file and your payments are made on time.

# Blocking
Have a doctors appointment that you dont want a teammate to schedule over? Notion Calendars blocking features make it easy to block events across your various calendars. For example, Notion Calendar can put a block on your work calendar for an event you have on your personal calendar, so people know youre busy without being able to see your personal commitments. You can block single events or auto-block whole calendars.

##########################################

### Block an event or an entire calendar
On desktop or web:
- Right-click an event and selectBlock on calendar.
- Select the calendar you want to create a block in.
- To create a block for a single event, selectThis event. Alternatively, you can selectAll events from {calendar name}to set up auto-blocking. For example, if you are creating a block on your work calendar for an event on your personal calendar, you can synchronize the two calendars so that all future events from your personal calendar will be blocked on your work calendar.
- Choose toInclude detailsfrom the original calendar event in the block, or simplyShow as busy. This will apply to future blocks if you choose to auto-block.

##########################################

To see what details youve shared on a calendar block, right-click the original event and select Block on calendar. There will be anext to the calendar where the block was set up  if the lock is open, that means the events details have been shared. If the lock is closed, that means the events details are hidden.
Alternatively, you can hide the original calendar from view by selecting the eye icon next to its name in the left sidebar. Then, you can find the block on your other calendar and see its details.
## Remove blocking
You can remove blocks the same way you created them. Right-click a blocked event and unselect the calendar where the block lives. You can unblock a single event, or turn off auto-blocking by unblocking all events.

##########################################

You may want to undo auto-blocking for a calendar that you no longer have access to. Were working to improve this experience, but in the meantime you can reach out to[emailprotected].

# Collaborate in a workspace
## Real-time collaboration
- You can see which teammates are working on what because their avatars/profile photos will appear next to any block they clicked on or are editing. Here's how that looks in practice:
- Edits, comments, and suggestions made by other people will appear to you in real-time.
- You can edit the same block as someone else at the same time. Unlike other document software, content is not locked if someone else is making changes to it. The most recent change will be reflected on the page.

Tip:When other people are viewing the same page as you, click on their avatar at the top to jump to wherever they're reading or editing.

##########################################

## Lock pages and databases
If you have a lot of people in the same workspace, it can be easy for accidental edits and changes to get made to a page or database. You can useLock pageorLock databaseto prevent this without fully revoking edit rights from other members of your workspace.
### Lock page
For pages that contain non-database content, like documents, notes, wikis, etc., you can lock the content so that no one can make changes unless they explicitly turn the lock off  including you.
- Clickat the top right corner of your page.
- Turn onLock pagein the menu that appears.
- Your page will immediately become read-only for everyone.

##########################################

- You can tell if a page is locked because a grayLockedindicator will appear next to the name of your page in the top breadcrumb menu.

Note:Anyone with full or edit access to your page can turn page lockoff using the same menu. It's designed to provide one layer of extra protection so people have to be intentional about the changes they make.

### Lock views
For full page databases, you can lock in structure while allowing other members of your workspace to continue editing the actual data.

##########################################

- Clickat the top right corner of the page.
- Switch on the toggle next toLock databasein the menu that appears.
- Immediately, everyone on the page (including you) will only be able to edit the data the database contains, but not views or properties.
- TurnLock databaseoff using the same toggle in themenu.
- When a database is locked, you'll seeLockednext to its title in the top breadcrumb menu.

# Format your page
## Columns
Sometimes, it makes sense to put pieces of information next to each other. In these situations, you can format your text intocolumns(or create side-by-side sections with headings) usingdrag and drop:
- Click and drag the text you want to put in another column. (Thesymbol in the left margin is your handle for drag and drop.)
- Follow the blue guides that appear.
- Drop it where you want it. You just created a new column!

Note:Columns are available on tablet but not mobile. On your phone, you'll see the content in any right-hand column simply placed under the content in the left column.

##########################################

### Remove columns
To remove columns, simply do the reverse of the action you took to create them.
- Click theicon and hold to drag the content in your right-hand column back under or above the content in the left-hand column. When you see the blue guide span the width of the page, drop it and the columns should disappear.
- Sometimes, it's possible to have an empty column. In this case, click theicon and selectDelete. This also removes the column format.

Tip:You can resize columns by hovering over the edges they share with other content and dragging the gray vertical guides that appear left or right.

# Common formula errors
## Permissions
If you dont have access to a referenced database, formulas wont be able to compute reliably. This is because formulas require access to the source database and its property configurations.
How to fix it
Ensure you have access toallpages and databases referenced in your formula within your button or database automation.
## Wrong return type
Unlike formula properties in databases, formulas in automations expect a specific return type from the formulas (ex.: date, text, number, person). The automation will otherwise fail to save and execute properly.
How to fix it

##########################################

Make sure the formula returns the correct type of value. For example, if writing a formula to set the value of a Person property of a page, the formula must return a user or list of users, not a date. Alternatively, if evaluating a specific condition on an array type property (ex.: multi-select), make sure to use.includesinstead of==in yourif()statement.
## Formula depth limit reached
Notion formulas can only be15 layers deep. Every time a formula references another formula or rollup, it adds a layer. This applies even if the formula is in a different database.
When this limit is reached, Notion will show an error message.
How to fix it

##########################################

Simplify your setup by combining unnecessary formulas and rollups into fewer properties. Look for places where multiple formulas do similar things and try to merge them into one.
## Referencing variables in other variables
If custom variables are definedwithin the same automation action, they cannot reference each other.
For example, if you definevar1andvar2in the same action,var2wont be able to usevar1in its definition.
How to fix it
Define each variable in itsown separate action(create the first variable, add a new action to your automation, and define the next variable separately). This ensures that each variable is properly recognized.

##########################################

## Referencing variables in filters
Today, variables defined in an automation may not be used to filter pages in databases youd like the automation to act on (ex.: Edit pages that match filter containsvariable").
How to fix it
- Define a custom variable asThis pageby typingTrigger pagein the formula box.
- Add anEdit pages inaction and select the custom variable from step 1 as your target.
## Referencing database properties
When writing a formula in an automation, databasepropertiesmay not appear automatically. This isnt a bug  you just need to use a specific syntax.
How to fix it
To reference database properties from the trigger page, typeTrigger page.(make sure to add.at the end). This will reveal all available property options.

##########################################

## Referencing relations and people
When working with relations, rollup, and person properties in formulas, the formulas return a list of pages or people. To reference properties within the relation, youll need to define the first element, otherwise your automation will pause. You might also encounter this issue when creating a formula that uses the map function for a relation property.
How to fix it
Use functions like.first()or.at(0)to get the first element, or loop through the list of pages with functions like.map(),.filter(),.every(),.some(),.find().
## Undefined value
When formulas run on an empty value (ex.: Date, Person, etc), the automation will get an error and automatically pause.
How to fix it

##########################################

Useifandempty()to check whether a value is present before running the Person or Date function on it.
For example, if your formula runs on a Person property named Owner, create the following if statement to force a value:if(empty(This page.Person.first()), No person, This page.Person.first().name()). This ensures that even if there is no Owner, the automation will safely execute.
Alternatively, set up a view that filters to the Date or Person value being defined, and apply their automation to that view.
## Common syntax errors
If your formula isnt working as expected, it might be due to a syntax error such as missing parentheses, incorrect operators, or unsupported functions. For a full breakdown of formula syntax, readthis article

# Data accessible by your workspace owner
If you are accessing any Notion workspace using an email address or account assigned to you by your employer or other organization (for example, you use your work email to access a workspace administered by your employer), it is important to note that the workspace owner could have access to the data you store in that Notion workspace, including any private pages in that workspace. Additionally, the workspace owner can turn off Notion services or restrict your ability to move data to or from the organizational workspace. Please read ourTerms of Servicefor more information.

##########################################

If you access Notion with an email address or account assigned to you by your employer or other organization, your agreement or legal relationship with that workspace owner might affect:
- Who owns the data or content that you submit or upload through your account
- The conditions under which you may access your account or when your account may be disable.
- Who may access or delete the data in your account.
Please note, whenever you access anEnterprisePlan workspace (as a member or a guest), the workspace owners will have access to the data you store in that Notion workspace.

You can also access Notion for free, for personal use outside of your managed account, by signing up with your personal email here:https://www.notion.com/signup.

##########################################

# Data sources & linked databases
## Choosing a data source
When you make a database, youll be given the option to select an existing data source from the workspace or to a create a brand new one.
We suggest selecting an existing data source if you want to use the same properties from another database, or an existing view living elsewhere in your workspace. Search for an existing database and then choose the one you'd like to use.

##########################################

We suggest creating a new data source if the information you're adding to the database is completely new and doesnt exist anywhere else in your workspace, or if you want to keep it separate from other data. To create a new database, clickNew table,New list, etc. (depending on the type of view you are creating) in the menu that appears.
## Create a linked database
Think of each linked database as a two-way excerpt of the source database. It references the same source data, but has its own views, filters, and sorts.

##########################################

- In a page, type/linkedand press enter.
- A menu will pop up that allows you to type to search for specific databases in your workspace. You can also scroll to browse.
- The database you select will show up as a copy of the original, which you can filter, sort, and view differently without changing the original.
## Edit linked databases
- When interacting with a linked database, the views, filters, or sorts you create and delete will not affect the views on the original database.
- However, edits you make to theactual contentorpropertiesof a linked databasewillbe reflected in the original.
- You can add as many linked databases as you would like inline on a single page. Filter them for different purposes to create your own dashboard.

##########################################

# Database automations
Database automations are sequences of actions that happen any time a specific change to a database occurs. Automations consist of both triggers (the events that initiate the automation) and actions (the effect of the automation). Database automations are meant to help save you time and simplify your work, and can be very basic or more complex depending on your needs.
Database automations can be used for many things, including:
- Assigning a task to a specific person when its status changes.
- Sending a Slack notification to a channel when a page is added to a database.

##########################################

Note:
- Automations wont take action on any pages whose access is restricted.You can check and change page access in theshare menu.
- Database automations can't be triggered by other automations.Button actions, however, can trigger database automations. For example:A recurring template automation will not trigger a database automation.A database automation creating a page in another database will not trigger a database automation.A user clicking a button that creates a page will trigger a database automation.
* A recurring template automation will not trigger a database automation.
* A database automation creating a page in another database will not trigger a database automation.
* A user clicking a button that creates a page will trigger a database automation.

##########################################

## Who can use database automations?
- Database automations are available onpaid plansonall platforms.
- Database automations can be created, edited, or deleted bypaid plan users who have full access to the database.
- However,Slack automationscan only be edited by the automationcreator.
- Free Plan users can createSlack notificationautomations, but no other kinds of automations.
- Free Plan users can use existing automations intemplates, but they won't be able to edit them.

##########################################

## Create a database automation
To create a database automation:
- Clickat the top of a database New automation.
- Give your database automation a name if youd like.
- SelectNew triggerto create a trigger. Then selectAdd triggerto create more triggers. Learn more about the types of triggersbelow 
- SelectNew actionto create an action. Then selectAdd actionto create more actions. Learn more about the types of actionsbelow 
- SelectCreate.

Did you know you can also add a button property to your database? With the click of a button, actions can be taken on your database on your behalf.Learn more here

##########################################

## Database automation triggers
Automations can have one trigger or multiple triggers. When you set up an automation, you can decide whether the automation will take placeWhen any of these occurorWhen all of these occur.

Note:If you have multipleis editedtriggers that mustalloccur for your automation to take place, those triggers need to happen within a small window of about three seconds. If they dont, your automation may not be triggered properly. To avoid this, you can:
- Create separate automations for each trigger.
- Use a more specific trigger thanis edited, likeis set toorcontains.

##########################################

You can choose from three types of triggers:
- Page addedmeans your automation will be triggered when a new page is added to your database.
- Property editedmeans your automation will be triggered when a specific property from your database is edited. For name, person, number, text, select, and relation properties, you can choose what kinds of edits made to that property will trigger an automation. For example, you might have a list of contacts in a Notion database and set up an automation where the trigger is a phone number starting with the numbers 732, and the action is that persons state being set to New Jersey.
- Every {frequency}means your automation will be recurring. The trigger will happen repeatedly based on the frequency you set. You can set your automation to repeat every day, week, month, and so on. You can also set a time that the automation will be triggered, the date that the automation trigger will begin and end, and the timezone.Note:TheEvery {frequency}trigger works with all automation actions except forEdit property.

##########################################

You can have more than one condition for your trigger so that two or more things must be true for the automation to occur. Note that a recurring trigger (like one that you set to repeat every week, month, etc.) cant be paired with another type of trigger.
## Database automation actions

Note:If youd like your automation to add or edit pages and databases, make sure that you have permission to edit those pages and databases. Otherwise, your automation wont work.

##########################################

Automations can take one action or multiple actions. You can choose from a variety of actions:
- Edit propertywill edit the properties of pages in the database you are currently in. For multi-select, people, and relation properties, you can add or remove individual values instead of adding or removing all values at once. For example, you might have a task database where if the task name contains the word blog, your name is added to the people property, even if there are other people already assigned to that task.
- Add page towill add a page to a database of your choosing, and edit the properties of that page.
- Edit pages inwill edit pages and properties in a database of your choosing.
- Send notification towill send a notification to specific people in your Notion workspace. Your recipient can be up to 20 people in your workspace, or people who are associated with a certain People property in your database. Add a message that you want to go along with the notification.
- Send mail towill send an email from your Gmail account to one or more recipients. Learn more about this below.
- Send webhookwill send an HTTP POST requests to the specified URL. Learn more inthis article 
- Send Slack notification towill send a notification to the Slack channel you want. Learn more about Notion's Slack integrationhere 
- Define variableswill allow you to create a custom variable using mentions and formulas. You can then use this variable in other database automation actions. Learn more about this below.

### Define variables
You can define a custom variable with mentions and formulas. You can then use this variable in other database automation actions. To define a variable:
- Clickat the top of a database, then selectNew automationor an existing automation.
- SelectNew actionorAdd actionDefine variables.
- Click onVariable 1to give the variable a name, edit the formula, or duplicate it. You can also selectAdd variable.
- Select@orin the variable field to define your variables.
- You can use these variables in additional automation actions.

##########################################

Lets look at an example of when and how youd create a custom variable. Lets say you want to set an automation where when a parent task is marked as complete, all of its sub-tasks are automatically marked as complete.

##########################################

- Clickat the top of a database, then selectNew automationor an existing automation.
- Select the trigger asStatus set to Complete.
- SelectNew actionorAdd actionDefine variables.
- Selectin the field belowVariable 1.
- In the window that opens, selectTrigger pagein the list of properties to the left.
- Put a period right afterTrigger pagein your formula, so that your formula readsTrigger page.. Once you do this, youll see the trigger pages properties in the list of properties to the left.
- SelectSub-item. Your formula should now readTrigger page.Sub-item.
- Saveyour formula. Now, your custom variable is defined as the sub-items of the page that triggers your automation, or in other words, the page that is marked as complete.
- Now, in your database automation settings, selectAdd action.
- SelectEdit pages in....
- Open theSelect databasedropdown and selectVariable 1. This means that the automation will edit pages associated with variable 1, or in other words, sub-items associated with the page that is marked as complete.
- Open theEdit a propertydropdown and selectStatus.
- Open theSelectdropdown and selectComplete.
- SelectSave.

##########################################

The next time you mark a parent item that has sub-items as complete, you should see all of the sub-items statuses change to complete too!
## Mentions and formulas in database automation actions

Note:
- At this time, mentions and formulas can only be used in database automationactions, not triggers.
- Formulas cant be used when sending Slack notifications.

##########################################

You can use mentions and formulas in your database automation actions to make your automations work better for you. For example:
- You might want to mention the date in the name of a new page created in your database.
- You might want to set up a database automation to send a notification to someone that mentions a specific page.
- You might want to automatically send a message to someone when a ticket has been resolved, and use a formula in that message that calculates the time it took to complete the ticket.

##########################################

To include a mention or formula in a database automation action:
- Clickat the top of a database, then selectNew automationor an existing automation.
- SelectNew actionorAdd action. Find the action you want and select it.
- As you set up the automation action, select@in the field if you want to mention a date, person, page, or a property from the trigger page in your database. Selectin the field if you want to create a formula.
- SelectSavewhen youre done.
## Database automation errors
To make sure your automation is working properly, well help you understand where your automation is invalid.

##########################################

If your automation runs into any errorswhile youre setting it up:
- Youll see information about where and what those errors are as youre building or editing the automation.
- You wont be able to save the automation until you make the required corrections.
If your automation hasworked before but runs into an error, the automation will be paused and youll get a notification. This situation might occur when:
- A database that your automation is adding to or editing is missing.

To create a template inside a database, click the dropdown arrow next toNewat the top right of your database. Then, select+ New template.
When editing a new or existing template, you'll see a bar across the top indicating which database it's located in.
Whatever you title this page will be the name of the template you use going forward. For instance, you might title this oneBug.
On this page, you can define properties for your template. For example, you can create a template for bug reports that automatically putsP1in the Priority property and assigns the userFigto the Product Manager property. You can also add content in the page itself.

##########################################

Templates can contain any type of content, including images, embeds, and sub-pages. Whatever you choose will show up identically on each page created with the template.

Note:If you add a relation property to a template, do not fill it in unless you want every page you create with that template to relate to the same existing page(s).

##########################################

## Use a database template

# Deploy Notion for macOS
Notion's desktop app provides IT administrators with enhanced control over installations and updates. You have the flexibility to select the installation path for Notion and manage update settings. By default, the Notion app is set up in the /Applications folder on your employees machines and is configured to update automatically with each new release.

Note:Regular updates are crucial for access to the latest features and ensuring the highest level of security, especially if automatic updates are turned off.

##########################################

## Installing Notion on shared machines
Notion allows for use on shared machines by multiple users. It can be installed in either the /Applications or ~/Applications folder of a user's machine. The best installation method depends on your organization's specific needs.
/Applications
- All users on the machine use the same installation of Notion.
- Updates made to Notion apply to all users on the machine.
- Users must be administrators to update Notion.
~/Applications
- Each user on a shared machine has their own installation of Notion.
- Updates made to one instance of Notion do not affect other instances of Notion for other users on the same machine.
- Users do not need to be administrators to update Notion.

##########################################

## Distribute Notion
After deciding on the installation method, download the appropriate Notion desktop app build. There are three builds available:Intel (x64),Apple Silicon (arm64), andUniversal (x64 or arm64). Ensure you distribute the correct build to match your employees' machine types.

Note:The Universal build works on Intel and Apple Silicon machines. Keep in mind the installation file is much larger than the other builds.

##########################################

## Disable automatic updates
Notion allows you to disable automatic updates for individual users. This feature is useful for when you want to test new Notion app versions before a widespread rollout, or if you prefer to stagger the update process. To keep the app working smoothly and securely, we advise updating Notion with each new version release.
To prevent Notion from automatically checking for updates, run the following terminal command as each user who will be running Notion:
defaults write notion.id NotionNoAutoUpdates -bool YES
Use the following command to re-enable automatic updates:
defaults write notion.id NotionNoAutoUpdates -bool NO

##########################################

## Allow users to update Notion
If Notion is installed in the ~/Applications folder, users can update the app independently without needing special permissions. However, if the app is installed in the /Applications folder, update permissions are required.Users must be machine administrators and have write access to /Applications, notion.app, and all its subfiles.

##########################################

For shared machines, we recommend setting up a permissions group for all Notion users and installing Notion in a subfolder of /Applications. You can grant this group ownership and write access to the subfolder using the terminal command below. Make sure you replacegroupwith your permissions group name andsubfolderwith your subfolder name:
chown -R :group /Applications/subfolder && chmod -R 775 /Applications/subfolder

##########################################

# Domain management
Domain verification allowsBusiness and Enterprise workspace ownersto claim ownership over an email address domain associated with their workspace. This unlocks domain management settings likeconfiguring SAML SSOfor your workspace, building Notion integrations usinglink previews, andcontrolling who can create workspaces(for Enterprise Plans only).
Domain verification does not impact your billing.
## Verify a domain for your workspace

Note: To do this, you must be a workspace owner on a Business or Enterprise Plan.

##########################################

To verify a domain for your workspace:
- Go toSettingsin your sidebar.
- SelectIdentity.
- Next toVerified domains, selectAdd domain.
- Enter your new domain and selectNext.
- Follow the prompts to update your DNS record.
- ClickVerifyto prompt Notion to check your DNS record.If your domains status isPending, selectnext to the domain View detailsVerifyto manually verify it.
* If your domains status isPending, selectnext to the domain View detailsVerifyto manually verify it.
- Once verification is complete, youll receive a confirmation email and your domains status will beVerified.

##########################################

Note:
- Typically, a change in the DNS record takes only minutes to propagate; however, there are cases where it may take up to 72 hours.
- You must verify a domain within one week of adding the domain. After a week, the verification code will expire and youll have to repeat the steps above.

## Verify a domain for an integration
If youre building an integration with Notion, like Link Previews, youll need to verify your domain in the integration management page (this action will not take place in Notion).
You can find the full instructions in ourDeveloper Guides
## Workspace creation permissions
Prerequisites for customizing workspace creation permissions

##########################################

- Workspace must be on the Enterprise Plan.
- You must be a workspace owner.
- You have verified at least one domain.Instructions for domain verification can be found above
### Customize permissions for workspace creation using your domain
You can customize permissions for who can create new workspaces using your verified domains.
- Go toSettingsIdentityWorkspace creation.
- SelectAnyoneto allow any user with your verified domain to create a new workspace.
- SelectWorkspace ownersto prevent users with your verified domain from creating new workspaces.

Note:The default setting for workspace creation permissions once a domain is verified is workspace owners only.

##########################################

## Enabling Domain Claim
Once a domain is verified, workspace owners on the Enterprise Plan can transfer, delete, or claim ownership over non-Enterprise workspaces created by users with their verified domain.
Prerequisites for viewing claimable workspaces
- You must be a workspace owner on the Enterprise Plan.
- Verified domain is a non-educational domain.
What workspaces are eligible?

##########################################

- Single-member workspaceThe workspace creators email belongs to the verified corporate domain.
* The workspace creators email belongs to the verified corporate domain.
- Multi-member workspaceThe workspace creators email belongs to the verified corporate domain (the creator does not need to be a current member of the space).At least one current workspace owner (either the creator or someone else) is using the verified corporate email address.
* The workspace creators email belongs to the verified corporate domain (the creator does not need to be a current member of the space).
* At least one current workspace owner (either the creator or someone else) is using the verified corporate email address.
- Workspace is not on the Enterprise Plan.

##########################################

## Notification period
Once a workspace owner verifies a domain, an automated email will be sent to all workspace owners of workspaces created with that domain, notifying them that their workspaces are eligible to be claimed.
During this 14 day notification period, workspace owners can only request ownership transfers on single-member workspaces. They will be unable to delete single-member workspaces or claim multi-member workspaces.
After a domain is verified, users who create new workspaces with a verified domain will be notified upon creation that their workspace is eligible to be claimed.

##########################################

## View claimable workspaces
Once a domain is verified, Enterprise workspace owners can view all non-enterprise workspaces created by users with their verified domain. This view can be found inSettingsIdentityDomain management.
For each workspace, this view includes:
- Workspace name
- Plan type
- Number of members
- Workspace owners
- Created at
- Created by
Workspace owners can take the following actions on their claimable workspaces:
- Request ownership change on single-member workspaces.
- Delete single-member workspaces.
- Claim multi-member workspaces.
Workspace owners can also export the list of claimable workspaces as a CSV.
- Go toSettingsIdentity.
- Click onBrowse workspacesand thenExport to CSVin the top right.

##########################################

## Change workspace ownership
With domain management, workspace owners on the Enterprise Plan can request a change in ownership transfer on single-member workspaces using a verified domain to a non-corporate email address. This is especially helpful when users created a workspace using a corporate email address, but use the workspace primarily for personal projects.

##########################################

Workspace owners need to initiate the change request in the workspace security settings. In the workspace settings, navigate to theIdentity & provisioningtab andBrowse workspacesin theDomain managementsection. From the claimable workspace view, complete the following steps:
- Select the single-member workspace that you would like to change.
- In themenu, selectRequire account change.
- Provide a contact email for questions from users about the request and confirm the action.
In the view, the workspace will enter aPendingstate.

##########################################

When the change request is submitted, an email notification will be sent to the workspace owner of the selected workspace and the user will not be able to access their workspace until they have completed the remaining transfer steps as follows:
- Log into the workspace.
- Follow the instructions and change email address associated with the account to a non-corporate email address.Note: While a single-member workspace ownership change is requested, the user cannot change the email associated with their user account.
- A verification code will be sent to the email address to confirm the users ownership of the account. Enter this verification code in the workspace.
- An automated email will be sent once the change is complete.

##########################################

Prerequisites for changing a workspace ownership
- You must be a workspace owner on an Enterprise Plan.
- The workspace to be changed must be on a single-member.
## Delete workspaces
With domain management, Enterprise workspace owners can more easily govern how a verified domain is used and where related projects are stored on Notion. When an employee leaves a company, Enterprise workspace owners can delete their single member workspaces to cleanup old content while remaining compliant.
Prerequisites for deleting a workspace
- You must be a workspace owner on the Enterprise Plan.
- The domain was verified at least 14 days ago.
- Workspace to be deleted must be a single-member workspace that is either free or not delinquent on payments.

##########################################

Note:Single-member workspaces that are deleted by an Enterprise workspace owner using domain management are not eligible for refunds or credits.
Go toSettingsIdentityand selectBrowse workspacesin theDomain managementsection.From the claimable workspace view, complete the following steps:
- Select the single-member workspace you would like to delete.
- Click themenu and selectDelete workspace.
- Provide a contact email for questions from users about the deletion and confirm the action.

##########################################

In the workspace view, aRecoverbutton will appear next to the selected workspace. When the deletion is initiated, an email notification will be sent to the workspace owner of the selected workspace. The single member workspace owner will immediately lose access to their workspace.

Note:Enterprise workspace owner will have 30 days to recover the workspace if needed. After 30 days, the workspace will be permanently deleted automatically.
Workspace was deleted by mistake?
If you receive an email notification about a workspace that has been deleted accidentally instead of transferred, please reach out to your respective Enterprise workspace owner provided in the email notification directly.

##########################################

Note:Only the Enterprise workspace owner who initiated the deletion can recover deleted workspaces. Notion Support cannot override Enterprise workspace owner actions to restore deleted workspaces.

##########################################

## Recover workspaces
To recover a deleted workspace, the Enterprise workspace owner that initiated the deletion cango toSettingsIdentityand selectBrowse workspacesin theDomain managementsection. From the claimable workspace view, complete the following steps:
- Go to the single-member workspace you would like to recover.
- Click on theRecoverbutton for the workspace and confirm.
- In the view the workspace will now appear without the recover button.
- The owner of the single-member workspace will regain access to their workspace and their workspace content will be restored.

##########################################

The workspace owner of the single-member workspace selected for deletion can request Notion Support extend the recovery timeframe by 30 days from the day they contact Support. After the recovery timeframe expires workspace data will be permanently deleted.
When a workspace is recovered, all page content in the workspace will be restored and the single-member workspace owner will regain access.
The following content cannot be recovered:
- Favorites
- Guest access
- Configured integrations (Bots)
- Domains (custom Notion domains)
## Claim workspaces
With domain management, workspace owners can establish authorized workspaces for employees to collaborate by claiming ownership over eligible multi-member workspaces.

##########################################

Note:If youre on the Enterprise plan with quarterly true-ups, please work with your dedicated Account Management team to claim workspaces and bring them under your Enterprise License.
In the workspace security settings,go toSettingsIdentityand selectBrowse workspacesin theDomain managementsection. From the claimable workspaces view, complete the following steps:
- Select the multi-member workspace that you would like to claim ownership.
- Verify payment information (only credit card payments are supported).
- Review and accept the billing implications of claiming the workspace.

##########################################

When the claim of ownership is processed:
- Claimed workspace will be upgraded to the Enterprise Plan.
- Workspace owner that claimed the workspace will become the only workspace owner.
- Previous workspace owners are downgraded to members (workspace owners can re-assign roles and permissions as necessary).
Prerequisites for claiming a workspace

##########################################

## Embeds in Notion
Notion allows you to embed external content from over 1,900 domains via theIframelyservice. This enables you to bring videos, screencasts, slide decks, images, audio, code repositories, and more into your Notion pages, so that you can keep all context in one place. As needed to display embedded content, Iframely and the embedded app may receive the IP address of the content's viewers.

Respondents for forms available toAnyone on the web with linkwill automatically be anonymous.In forms created from scratch, this information will be captured in theRespondentproperty, which is automatically created in your database.In forms created from an existing database, you can create aCreated byproperty in the database to capture this information.
* In forms created from scratch, this information will be captured in theRespondentproperty, which is automatically created in your database.
* In forms created from an existing database, you can create aCreated byproperty in the database to capture this information.
- Copy the link to the form at the top of the menu and youre ready to share.

##########################################

Note:If youre sharing a form that is part of a template you have duplicated into your Notion workspace, make sure you set up a separate version of the form from scratch so that all of your form responses go to you and not the original forms creator.
## Fill out a form
You can fill out a form using your desktop or mobile device as long as you have the form link and the permissions required to do so. Keep in mind that some forms can only be filled out when youre logged into the Notion workspace where that form has been created.

##########################################

To get a copy of your form responses, youll need to log into your Notion account or create a new one. Youll only be able to edit your form responses if you haveCan edit contentaccess to the database, orCan editaccess to the database page where your responses are stored.
## View and analyze form responses

##########################################

Note:
- To view form responses, you must have at leastCan viewaccess to the database that the form is connected to.
- To edit form responses, you must have at leastCan edit contentaccess to the database that the form is connected to.
- If your form has a very high volume of responses, it might be slower to load. You might want to create a second version of your form or delete older responses that you no longer need.
- At this time, you can't export a Form view of a database. Try exporting your questions and responses from Table view instead.

By default, form responses will be stored in aTable viewof your database namedResponses. Youll see your form questions as database properties.

##########################################

You can analyze your form responses byfiltering and sortingthem. You can alsoadd a chart view to your databaseandcustomize itto visualize your responses. Learn more about how to analyze your form responses here
## Build automations in your form
You canbuild automations into your formso that specific actions can be taken when you get a new response or when a question is answered a certain way. You can send status updates to the respondent, send them notifications in Slack, and more.
To do this:
- Open your form builder.
- Selectat the top Automations.
- Add one or more triggers for the automation.
- Add one or more actions for the automation.
Learn more about automationshere

##########################################

## Prevent members from sharing forms to the web
If youre a workspace owner on an Enterprise Plan, you can prevent workspace members from making forms available to anyone on the web who has the link. To do this, workspace owners can:
- Go toSettingsSecurity.
- In theSecuritytab, toggle onDisable publishing sites and forms.
Any forms already live on the web will be taken down once you turn this setting on. Note that turning this setting on will also prevent members of your workspace from publishingNotion Sites.
## Report a form
If you would like to report inappropriate content in a form, write an email to[emailprotected]with a link to the form youd like to report. If you can, include information about why youre reporting the form.

# Formula syntax & functions

- Looking for Notion formula basics? Check outthis article 
- If you have a formula that doesn't seem to work, learn about common formula errors and how to troubleshoot them inthis article

Notion formulas can operate using various properties and functions. Here, you'll find a list of them!
## Properties
Formulas support almost all property types. Note that formula types are different from property types.

# Intro to formulas
Notion formulas can perform helpful calculations using your existing database properties, built-ins, and functions.
## Formula examples
Lets look at a few different ways to use formulas. If youre ready to get started building your own, jump to our instructions on creating a formulabelow
### Example 1: Project management
In this example, well use three formulas to track the progress of projects.

You can explore and play with the formula setups for this example by duplicatingthis pageto your workspace!

##########################################

Table: [[Goal,Property name,Formula,Functions and built-ins used,]
[Set a projects due date as two weeks after its start date,Due date,dateAdd(Start Date, 2, "week"),dateAdd()adds time to the date. The unit argument can be one of the following:years,quarters,months,weeks,days,hours, orminutes. In this case, well useweeks.,]
[Mark a project as overdue if the due date has passedandits status is notDone.Mark a project as overdue in bold, red letters if the due date has passedandits status is notDone.,Overdue?,if(and(now() > Due Date, Status != "Done"), "Overdue", "")if(and(now() > Due Date, Status != "Done"), style("Overdue", "red", "b"), ""),if()returns the first value if the condition is true; otherwise, returns the second value. This allows for a conditional outcome.and()is a logical operator. This allows to evaluate multiple factors as being true.now()returns the current date and time. This allows to evaluate where we stand now, compared to the project due date.>is a comparison operator. This allows to compare the condition of due date being larger than current date.!=is a comparison operator. This allows to define the condition of status not being equal toDone.style()adds styles and colors to the text. Valid formatting styles includeb(bold),u(underline),i(italics),c(code), ors(strikethrough). Valid colors aregray,brown,orange,yellow,green,blue,purple,pink, andred. Add_backgroundto colors to set background colors. In this case, well applyboldandred.,]
[Show the number of overdue tasks associated with a project,Tasks remaining,length(Tasks.map(current.Status != "Done")),length()returns the length of the text or list value. This allows for a count of remaining tasks.map()returns the list populated with the results of calling the expression on every item in the input list. This looks at the tasks database and pulls in all applicable tasks.!=is a comparison operator. This allows to pull tasks whose current status is notDone.,]]

##########################################

### Example 2: Project brainstorming
In this example, well use two formulas to brainstorm project ideas, calculate a priority score for each of them, and count the number of upvotes each project receives.

You can explore and play with the formula setups for this example by duplicatingthis pageto your workspace! For another setup that uses the RICE framework, check out thistemplate.
Table: [[Goal,Property name,Formula,]
[Based off of the scores for Reach, Impact, Confidence, and Effort (RICE), calculate a prioritization score,Score (RICE),Reach * Impact * Confidence / Effort,]
[When someone clicks the upvote button, count them toward the number of total votes and add their name to the database page,Total votes,length(Upvoted by),]]

##########################################

### (Advanced) Example 3: Task management automation
In this example, well use some formulas in a databaseautomation(another kind of database property) to make it easier to manage projects and tasks as theyre completed by marking a parent task asDonewhen all its subtasks areDone.
Database automations have triggers and actions that are taken based on those triggers. Formulas allow you to define variables that you can then use in your actions.

You can explore and play with the formula setups for this example by duplicatingthis pageto your workspace!

##########################################

Table: [[Goal,How to build it,Functions and built-ins used,]
[Every time a task is set toDone, trigger the automation,Trigger:When status set toDone,-,]
[Define the parent task by finding the first page related to the task that triggered the automation,Action 1:DefineParent taskvariableFormula:Trigger page.Parent item.first(),Trigger pagereferences the page in the database the automation was triggered from, and.allows you to access properties associated with that page.Parent itemreturns the contents from that property, which in this case is a list of related pages.Applying the.first()function on theParent itemproperty returns thefirstrelated page from that list.,]
[If the parent task has subtasks, verify whether all its subtasks have a status ofDone. If the parent task has no subtasks, returnfalse.,Action 2:DefineAll subtasks done?variableFormula:Parent Task.Sub-item ? Parent Task.Sub-item.every(current.Status == "Done") : false,The ternary operatorX ? Y : Zis a shorthand conditional expression that means:ifthe condition X is true, return Y;otherwise, return Z. It's a concise alternative to anif()statement..every()checks whether a condition is true for each item in a list. Within this function, you can use the keywordcurrentto refer to the row being evaluated. In this case, the conditioncurrent.Status == "Done"checks whether the current pages status property is set toDone. If so, it will returntrue; otherwise it will returnfalse.,]
[If all subtasks areDone, set the parent tasks status toDone. If not, retain the existing status of the parent task.,Action 3:EditStatus propertyFormula:All subtasks done? ? "Done" : Parent Task.Status,Again, the ternary operator is used here to see if all subtasks are done. If they are, the automation will set the parent tasks status asDone; if not, it will keep the parent tasks status as is.,]]

More formula inspiration
- This Notion templatecalculates the time between two dates with a formula property.
- This Notion templateuses a formula to count upvotes for different ideas.
- You can find even more example formulashere

## Where formulas can be used
In Notion, you can use formulas in a few different ways:
- As a database property, which is what this article primarily covers.
- In abuttonaction.
- In adatabase buttonaction.
- In adatabase automationaction.
## Create a formula
To create a formula database property:
- Selectat the top of a database PropertiesNew property.
- SelectFormula.
- Give your property a name if youd like.
- SelectEdit formula.

##########################################

## Edit a formula
Once youve created a formula in a database or button, youll be able to build and edit that formula in the formula editor, which looks like this:
The field at the top is where you enter and edit your formula. As you write your formula at the top of the editor, the editor will let you know whats missing, or what the formula expects in order to return a value to you.
The panel on the left side of the edit shows the elements that you can use in the formula  in other words, the properties, built-ins, and functions that are available to you.
The panel on the right side defines formula elements as you hover over them in the left panel. It also gives you examples of how you might use those elements and how they should be structured.

##########################################

If you open the formula editor from a database row, you'll see a live preview of the result of the formula for that row.

## What formulas are made of
Formulas can be created using a combination of:
- Properties.
- Built-ins, or operators and booleans that are used to set up a specific calculation. Some examples include+(add),false, andor.
- Functions, or actions that the formula can take to return a certain output. Some examples includereplace,sum, andsort.
A full list of the built-ins and functions that are available in formulas is availablehere

# 10 AI prompts to help marketers write better copy, faster
Marketing your business involves consistently sharing fresh, interesting content across different channels.
Notion AI can help you dream up endless content ideas and craft engaging posts for all your channels. Brainstorm, outline, write, and edit any kind of text, and never worry about running out of things to say to your audience.
In this guide, youll discover 10 AI prompts for writing marketing copy.
## Blog post
If blog posts are the core of your content strategy, youll know how cumbersome it can be to outline, write and edit articles on a regular basis.
But with Notion AI, youll be able to write and publish blog posts in a fraction of the time it usually takes.

##########################################

Kick off the process with an AI-powered brainstorming session. Hit the spacebar on a new line to summon AI, then scroll down toBrainstorm ideasin theDraft with AImenu. Ask for blog post ideas about your chosen topic, and then tell Notion AI to create an outline for you.
Once you have an outline on your page, you can select theBlog postoption and start writing with a prompt like:
Draft a blog post based on [the outline above] about [topic], and include [step-by-step instructions] in each section
Once you have a draft, edit with AI by highlighting any section of text and asking AI to continue writing, check spelling and grammar, adjust the tone of voice, and more.

##########################################

Combining the power of AI with your brands unique perspective, youll be able to write blog posts that are ready to post in a fraction of the usual time.
## Social Media Posts
Publishing social media posts every day is essential to keep your audiences engaged and your brand top of mind for your followers, but it can be challenging to think of new content ideas every day.
One of the best ways to use AI for social media posts is to ask for a series of social media posts based on another piece of content, like a blog post.

##########################################

Try the following prompt on a page containing a blog post draft:
Create a series of 10 [LinkedIn] posts based on the content of [this article]. Make the posts eye-catching and engaging to B2B decision-makers, so they feel motivated to request a demo.
AI can also help you write captions for your Instagram posts if you explain the content of the image or video and what you want to talk about in the caption.
## Email Newsletters
To compose your weekly newsletter with AI, start by creating a newsletter template in your content calendar. In that template, outline your newsletter with sections you normally include (updates, learnings, recommendations, etc.) and add bullet points underneath each heading.

##########################################

Then, at the top of the page, add aCustom AI blockwith a prompt like:
Write another edition of the newsletter using the outline and information below.
Every week, generate a newsletter from the template, fill out some information in the bullet points then ask Notion AI to write the latest edition for you.
## Website Copy
Whether youre building a website from scratch or updating your existing copy, use Notion AI to generate several different versions of the copy and choose the best options.
You can paste existing copy from your website into Notion or write a very rough draft of what you need to say.

##########################################

Then, ask Notion AI to come up with several versions of the copy. Make sure to include the purpose of the text, which benefits you want to highlight, and what the call to action should be:
Here is an example prompt to try:
Create several [shorter] versions of the text below. Make it sound [exciting], [persuasive] and include the benefits of [signing up for a free trial]
Once you have a few options, select the ones you like best and ask Notion AI to create some more. You can edit and refine your favorite results until youre happy with them.

##########################################

## Video scripts
Writing video scripts is different from other content because your writing will be read aloud. You probably want it to sound more conversational, however, you still need to convey information clearly.
To write a video script with Notion AI, provide as much information about the topic as possible in the prompt, especially if the video will be something like a product tour or tutorial.
Heres a sample prompt you could use:
Write a script for a video tutorial using a casual, conversational tone explaining step by step how to do [x]. Highlight the following three features: [feature 1, 2, and 3] plus their benefits
## Case studies
With Notion AI, you can turn a customer interview into a case study effortlessly.

##########################################

Start by pasting a transcript of the customer interview into your Notion page. Now, ask Notion AI to write a case study based on the text. You can do this with a custom AI block, or just by opening the AI menu and typing a custom prompt.
Turn this customer interview into a case study. Use quotes from the interview above. Explain how we were able to solve the customers problem and take them [from A to B] / [achieve [x] result]
If you store user feedback or customer stories in a database, you can also useAI autofill propertyto extract insights or get a quick summary of the results.

##########################################

## Research for white papers
Writing a white paper can seem like a huge undertaking, but Notion AI can help you turn your data or survey results into an easily digestible downloadable resource.
TheAI autofill propertylets you apply Notion AI to entire databases, and this could be helpful when creating a white paper.
Compile all your data or survey results into a Notion database, and add a new property. There are three AI Autofill properties that generate text based on the contents of a page: Summary, Key insights, or Custom.
In aCustom AI property, try prompting AI to:
Summarize this page and generate 1-3 of the most noteworthy insights

##########################################

## Press releases
Your press releases likely follow a familiar format. Just like the newsletter, you can create a database template to outline press releases in your content database.
Create a new template in the database and add a custom AI block instructing Notion AI to write a press release based on the information on the page.
Elsewhere on the template page, you can write a press release outline and writing guidelines. Every time you need to write a press release, create a new page from the template and add additional information about the features or updates you want to announce.

##########################################

Use the following prompt:
Write a press release according to the [outline] and [press release writing guidelines] below, about the information in the [update] section.
## Product descriptions
To write product descriptions with Notion AI, first create a table database with all your products. Include as much information as possible about each product, and you can also paste in existing descriptions from your website if you have them.
You could generate new product descriptions by using a custom AI autofill property, or a custom AI block inside the page.
Either way, prompt Notion AI to write the product description based on the page information and specific instructions regarding the style and tone of voice you want.

##########################################

Heres a sample prompt:
Write a product description. Explain succinctly what [this product] does and how it benefits users, in [less than 100 words]. The tone of voice should be [witty], [light-hearted], [aspirational], but [practical].
## Ad copy
If youre running paid ads, youll know that getting the copy on point can increase your conversions.
But sometimes, you dont know what will work best until youve tried it.
Notion AI can generate several variations of ad copy until you find something that resonates. You can even try out several versions to see which ones get the best results.

##########################################

Heres a prompt for writing ad copy with AI:
Write copy for a [channel] ad, explaining [product]. We want people to [sign up for a free trial]. Make sure to highlight [benefit 1] and [benefit 2]. 20-30 words maximum. Generate 10 variations.

##########################################

# 5 AI prompts to surface fresh insights from your databases
Your databases are packed with information, and you can quickly bring the most valuable insights to the surface using Notions AI autofill property.
Bringing the time-saving efficiency and creative enhancement of Notion AI into your databases makes it easier to parse large sets of data and get the key takeaways from every page at once.
This guide will show you:
- How to add an AI autofill property and customize it
- 5 custom prompts and how to use them in different situations
- More specific prompt ideas to spark your creativity

##########################################

## 1. Generate a custom, auto-updating summary of page content
Databases allow you to aggregate pages and categorize them using properties. As you gather more and more information, its helpful to get a high-level summary of what pages contain, without having to open each item one by one.
By asking AI to generate a summary of the page content, youll get a quick a heads-up about what a page is about, the information it contains, and whether its complete or lacking information.
SelectingAI summaryfrom the properties menu automatically summarizes all your database entries. However, if you want to be more specific about the style and length of your summary, add an AI custom autofill property.

##########################################

Try the following custom prompt:
Summarize the content of this page in one short sentence
Adjust the prompt if you want AI to summarize the content in three words, in bullet points, or to summarize in simple terms.

##########################################

- Get a simple summary of a technical document Use the AI custom property to summarize a technical document like a product or feature spec in simpler language so non-technical team members and collaborators can understand it at a glance.
- Summarize drafts in your content calendar Add a custom property to your content calendar to summarize blog articles, social media posts or ebooks.
- Generate a summary of resources youve saved If youre using Notions web clipper to save interesting articles or posts into your library, an AI summary property can produce a helpful summary.

##########################################

## 2. Automatically extract action items
You can use a custom autofill property to scan your pages for potential action items. This surfaces things you or your team may need to do, prevents tasks from getting missed or forgotten, and saves you from trawling through lengthy documents to search for tasks manually.
Use the following prompt:
Search this page for action items and create a bulleted list of tasks we need to do

##########################################

Use this to:
- Break out tasks to do from a project brief If youve created a scope doc or brief for a project, the autofill property will be able to scan the page for potential tasks using the above prompt. You can easily view them along with the project brief, or add them straight to your tasks database.
- Extract action items from meeting notes After you finish taking notes in your Meetings database, you can use the AI autofill property to extract potential tasks to-do from those notes, ensuring nothing youve discussed will get forgotten or missed.
- Create a daily to-do list from a journal entry If you journal in Notion, you can automatically scan your entries for tasks you need to do, and use this as your daily to-do list.

##########################################

## 3. Discover the key themes or insights of a page
Quickly get the most important takeaway of any database page with a custom prompt to extract key themes and insights.
You can ask Notion AI to assess the overall theme, mood, or sentiment of a page.
Try the following prompt:
Create a numbered list of the three main takeaways from this page
Alternatively, you can try asking Notion to Explain this page in three words or Describe the overall mood or sentiment of the page content.

##########################################

This comes in handy when you want to:
- Quickly assess the sentiment of survey resultsIn a database with survey results or user feedback, you can use this prompt to gauge the overall sentiment of each response.
- Get the main takeaways from a research paper or study Discover the key findings of lengthy research or scientific paper before you dive in to read the whole thing.
- Discover common themes from a brainstorming sessionAfter running a brainstorming workshop and documenting the process in a Notion database, Notion AI autofill can provide some insight about what topics came up repeatedly.
- Pull deadlines from a page If your page mentions tasks or milestones, you can customize the prompt to scan for impending deadlines.

##########################################

- Easily categorize content drafts or ideas If youre drafting content in Notion, you can use AI autofill to categorize each piece. You can adjust the prompt to something like Categorize this page according to its key topics.
## 4. Flag risks or blockers
Risks or blockers that go unnoticed can derail your projects, but AI can automatically catch any roadblocks before they become a problem for you or your team.
Try the following prompt:
Search this page for any potential problems, risks, or blockers that may prevent progress, and list them briefly

##########################################

Some examples of when to use this:
- Make everyone aware of tasks that are blocking progress A task cant be completed until several sub-tasks are done. This property makes it clear what needs to happen first.
- Flag missing information so you can move forward During a client call, you discussed needing to find a time to meet. However, you werent able to find a mutually suitable time. Your AI autofill property can detect this from your meeting notes.
- Highlight risks or requirements of a projectIn a project plan or product spec, you can use AI autofill to search for risk factors that may affect whether the project is viable, for example, capabilities, resources, and amount of time required.

##########################################

## 5. Identify key milestones
Whether youre managing client projects or setting yourself personal goals, defining key progress milestones can help to keep you on track.
Try using a custom AI prompt like the one below:
Suggest some possible milestones for this project/goal
This can be useful to:
- Define milestones for a project to present to your clientWhen youre planning a client project, you can easily outline some likely milestones.
- Measure your progress towards a goal Youve set yourself some goals and are tracking them in a Notion database. Your custom AI property will suggest relevant milestones so you can measure your progress.

##########################################

## Get creative with AI autofill property
The 5 examples above are general prompts that you can customize further according to your specific requirements. Experiment with the wording of your prompts to get the results you want, and, for the best results, be specific about the desired length and format of the response.
Here are a few more ideas for different ways to use the AI autofill property:
- List out recipe ingredients in your meal prep database Create an AI autofill property to list ingredients in your meal planning database. As you add new recipe ideas, youll automatically get a handy list of ingredients.

##########################################

- Automatically categorize database items If youd like to add helpful tags to your favorite recipes (vegetarian, vegan, contains nuts, gluten-free), you can use an AI autofill property to categorize them. You can also do this to categorize your digital bookshelf or movie database according to genre.
- Create a shopping list for your home renovation projectPlanning to renovate your bathroom or kitchen? Draft a project plan in your household projects database (or get Notion AI to help you write one) and then prompt an AI autofill property to generate a shopping list for the project.

# 5 steps to adopt Notion for your entire organization
Ready to get your team collaborating in a connected Notion workspace?
As you or your IT partners are starting to develop your Notion rollout plan, you might be wondering what you need to do to get everything up and running.
In this guide, well explain the 5 steps of bringing Notion to your organization  from workspace set-up, to ongoing maintenance. Each section contains a brief overview of what to do, plus links to more detailed guides that provide you with step-by-step instructions.

##########################################

This guide will help you:
- Understand how to prepare your company to successfully adopt Notion
- Import content into Notion for a consolidated work experience
- Find all the team enablement resources you need in one place
## Step 1: Create your workspace architecture
Spending some time to establish the architecture of your workspace will help you organize your information in a logical way, so team members can find what theyre looking for and know where to go to contribute their work.

##########################################

First youll need tocreate your Notion workspace. Once thats done, nominate some of your team members to become Workspace owners, who will be responsible for getting to grips with Notions security and permissions settings, understanding the different types of users (and how to set them up), and billing. Usually, this will be someone from your companys IT department who is working on security and permissions, plus your team leads or knowledge managers who will help to add content.
With IT setup underway, you can start structuring the workspace by dividing it into teamspaces. These are sections of the workspace that belong to departments of your company, which give each team a home for their work.

##########################################

Most organizations begin with a General teamspace for everyone, then create teamspaces for each department. Your general teamspace will be home to company-wide knowledge like docs, and meeting notes, while team-specific teamspaces tend to house project trackers, and custom workflows.
Check out these examples ofwikisthat store team knowledge, and custom project trackers like thiscontent calendarorproduct roadmap.

##########################################

## Step 2: Populate your workspace with content
A successful, organization-wide implementation includes thinking deeply about how you and other teams will work together. Consider what Notion use cases will be most beneficial to your team  project tracking, knowledge management, or documentation  and start creating those pages. If youre not sure exactly what goes in Notion, read through our guide onwhere Notion fits into your companys tool ecosystem.
As a Notion owner within your org, we generally recommend focusing on your company-wide and general use-cases, and assigning specific owners for team-based workflows. This step is probably the right time to start bringing those folks into the conversation.

##########################################

There are two ways to get up and running with content quickly: import content from another tool, or use templates.
### Importing content
You can import content from other tools directly into Notion, so you can pick up right where you left off.
First, connect and verify your accounts in the Settings menu, then open the Import menu in your sidebar, choose the tool you want to import from and follow the instructions.
How to import your content

### Using templates
Additionally, explore our Template gallery for ready-to-use systems for any need  from generic docs and notes to bespoke solutions for your team.

##########################################

Once you find what you want in the Template gallery, duplicate the page into the relevant teamspace, then customize them as needed to suit your team.
Start your teamspace with the following templates, and add more as needed

## Step 3: Bring your team on board
As you start to get your team members into Notion, youll want to make the process of adapting as smooth as possible.

##########################################

Here are some things you can do to help your team learn and adjust to Notion:
- Explain how Notion fits into your tool stackTeam members will need to understand how Notion connects to the rest of their tools. Your job is to show them the use cases, the value and why its different and better from what they do today.
- Create an onboarding page Send your team members to an onboarding page which contain all the resources theyll need to get started, like videos and guides to cover the basics. To start, check out the resources below.

##########################################

- Encourage experimentation in private pagesFolks can use the private section of the workspace to experiment with creating pages, inserting Notion blocks and playing around with databases.
- Introduce collaborative features Invite others to pages and projects. Start tagging people and commenting. This will start to create the flywheel of collaboration. Share things inside of Notion, and outside of it, in your messaging tools.
### Onboarding best practices
Make sure onboarding is successful by giving your team members all the information they need to use Notion confidently.

##########################################

- Get everyone to complete Notion Academy Start with Notion 101, and go from there.
- Measure progress with onboarding checklistsGive people an incentive to go through all the onboarding materials and measure their progress.
- Make it interactive Instead of a page of text, your onboarding page can include embedded videos, a gallery of resources and you can include your own tutorial videos showing how to use your workspace.

##########################################

### Provision members and secure your workspace
Collaboration is the heart of Notion, and as team members join the workspace, youll need to ensure everyone has the right level of access to the content they need and can contribute to their teams work. At the same time, youll want to limit the number of people who can make significant changes to the workspace, like adding new members and changing security settings.
There are four types of users in Notion -Workspace owners(who have full access to the workspace and security settings),Membership admins(Enterprise plan only),MembersandGuests.

##########################################

Workspace owners will be responsible for user management and provisioning access to content. Access can also be adjusted at page level. There are four levels of page access:Full access,Can edit,Can comment, andCan view.
Notion offers Single Sign-On (SSO) functionality for Business and Enterprise users, enhancing security and simplifying access management.
SAML SOO is available for workspaces on Notions Business or Enterprise Plans.

## Step 4: Build team-specific workflows with connections
Remember those teamspace owners you assigned in step 2? This is their time to shine. Once your teams are in place, youll want to start the process of building team-specific workflows, and connecting specialist tools to get the most out of your workspace.

##########################################

There are endless ways for teams to use Notion, but these are some of the most common use cases:
- Manage projects and tasks seamlesslyWith Notions integrated Projects & tasks system, teams can track daily work and larger projects effortlessly.
- Connect docs and meeting notes Use Notion databases to create and organize your documentation and take notes for every meeting. You can then connect information to the relevant project.
- Grow your teams knowledge base Build a knowledge base where team members can find all the information they need about the company and their role.

##########################################

### Connecting tools
Theres a good chance that even if you have several use cases for Notion, there may be certain other tools that team members want to keep using  either because some teams need specialist tools for their work, or because they are planning to migrate to Notion at a later date.
The good thing is that you can continue to use any specialist tools, while at the same time connecting all of your work to Notion.

##########################################

For example:
- Add link previews that give everyone contextWhen you paste a link into Notion, you have the option toPaste as preview, which gives a visualization of the content from the URL, which provides context.
- Create synced databases that contain up-to-date information Pull an entire database worth of content from tools like Github and Jira into a Notionsynced databasethats updated in real time.

##########################################

- Use connected properties in your databases Link Google Drive files, Figma files andGitHub pull requestsin your Notion database through special connected properties.
- Integrate with Slack for easier team communication If your team uses Slack to communicate, you canintegrate Slack with Notionto send automatic notifications and paste Slack messages into your pages.
## Step 5: Get the maximum value from your organizations Notion workspace
Once youve got your team using Notion, here are some best practices to make sure everyone gets the most out of the tool.
### Maintaining content quality
Prevent the workspace getting messy and make sure content stays up to date and relevant.

##########################################

- Assign page owners and use verification You can turn your company knowledge base into a wiki which gives it extra features, like page verification. Page owners can mark a page as verified to signal that the content is fresh.
- Organize the sidebar An untidy sidebar makes it difficult for team members to find what they need. Make sure the sidebar is organized and each teams pages are contained in their teamspace.
- Use theSearchfeatureTeam members can use theSearchfunction to find pages and information easily.

##########################################

### Continuously onboarding and scaling your team
- Continuously onboard When new teammates join your company, invite them to your Notion workspace and give them a tour using the resources above
- Check out new features Keep an eye on our Whats new page to incorporate new features and connections as theyre released, and share key features with your teammates to encourage deeper Notion use.
- Fine-tune team and workspace settings Its best to start simple on permissions, but as you grow, use permission settings to prevent unwanted edits to content and make sure information is safeguarded. Check out ourscaling your team courseto learn more.

# 5 ways to get more value out of your reading list with Notion AI
Notion databases let you collect and categorize a variety of information in helpful ways, and AI can help you get more value from that content and apply the learnings to your work, life, or studies.
Using Notion AI and AI autofill properties, you can automatically surface useful insights and key takeaways at a glance, so youll remember more and take action.
In this guide, youll learn 5 Notion AI tricks to get more value from your documents and resources.
## 1. Get an automatic summary of any content you save from the web
With NotionsWeb Clipper, you can save any web page to your workspace to read or edit later.

##########################################

The clipper brings text, images, and media right into your database page, helping you quickly grow your reading list or collect references, and consume content without leaving Notion.
When you combine this with an AI summary property, you can get a high-level overview of each saved resource, just from a quick glance at the database.
Add theAI Summaryproperty to your database for an automatic summary. For a more specific output, select aCustom AI autofillproperty and write your own prompt  for example, ask AI to summarize in three words, one sentence, 3 bullet points, etc.

##########################################

The benefits of automatic summaries:
- Speed up research for your next projectAs you collect resources to research for a project, a summary gives you a quick overview of what each source contains so you can prioritize the most helpful content.
- Get the gist of dozens of news articles on the same topic Easily understand the nuances and angles of various sources covering one topic.
- Filter through your recipes or travel suggestions faster An automatic summary helps you scan through your recipes or destinations database and find whats most relevant.

##########################################

## 2. Simplify complex documents
If youre working with any kind of technical documents, like product feature specs or scientific research papers, Notion AI can produce a simplified version of the text thats easier to understand.
To do this, highlight the text you want to simplify, open theAsk AImenu, and selectSimplify language. Alternatively, add a Custom AI block to your page and prompt AI to generate a simplified version of page content. If you create a custom block in your database page template, it will be there every time you create a new document from that template.

##########################################

When you simplify text, you can keep the original content and insert the simplified version above. This helps make information easier to digest and more accessible, especially if youre collaborating with others.
Simplifying complex documents will help you:
- Collaborate with non-technical teamsMake it easier for non-technical team mates or collaborators to understand content without getting confused by technical language
- Filter out technical jargon Complex terminology can obscure meaning of a text. Notion AI can help replace jargon with more everyday language.

##########################################

## 3. Ask specific questions about page content
If you want to generate a specific response based on page content, you can design your own custom AI prompt. Add a Custom AI autofill property to your database, write your prompt, and the results will display as a database property.
You can ask Notion AI to:
- List everyone mentioned on a pageNotion AI can surface any names mentioned in your page as a property - try prompting your custom AI property as follows:
List out every person mentioned on this page
- Provide 3 key insights or takeaways from a pageAsk Notion AI for key takeaways from a research paper, or insights from a brainstorming session in the format of a bulleted list.
Make a list of 3 key takeaways or insights from this research

##########################################

- Search for a daily highlight If youre journalling in Notion, ask AI to surface your highlight of the day.
Generate a highlight of the day from the page content
- Generate milestones for your goalsTrack your goals in a Notion database and use an AI autofill property to set appropriate milestones to help measure your progress.
Suggest possible milestones to help me reach this goal
- Extract action items from notes You can extract tasks to do from meeting notes, journal entries or project pages, so nothing gets missed.
Find all action items mentioned in this meeting note

##########################################

## 4. Automatically translate into another language
Plowing through lots of resources can be draining, especially if youre not reading in your native language.
You can automatically translate all or part of any page content into many different languages using Notion AI.
To do this, add aCustom AI blockto the page, or database template. Prompt AI to translate the page content into your chosen language.
If you dont want to translate the entire page, you can add aCustom AI Autofillproperty, and ask Notion AI to create a summary or list of key takeaways in your language.
So, even if youve saved a web page thats in English, you can ask Notion AI to:
Provide the 3 key insights from this page in Spanish

##########################################

Translating in Notion will help you:
- Reduce context-switching that breaks your focusInstead of going to a new tab to translate text, you have a translator built into your workspace.
- Remove friction or barriers to understandingWith the power to translate words, sections or entire pages at once, information becomes more accessible to all.
## 5. Recommend similar content
With Notion AI, youll never run out of things to read  you can use a Custom AI autofill property to recommend similar content.
For example, if youre tracking your reading in Notion, you can ask for book, movie, blog, and podcast recommendations based on content youve saved.
Generate at least three book recommendations based on this entry

##########################################

You could also discover more helpful resources to support your studies, research or projects.
Using Notion AI to recommend similar content means you can:
- Save time searching the web for similar books, movies or research Instead of trawling through search engine results, Notion AI can point you in the direction of your next helpful resource.
- Enjoy more of what you love Your own personal recommendation engine will help you discover your new favorite books, music or movies.

# Create streamlined project management workflows using database automations
As a project manager (or anyone who manages work), you might be inundated with repetitive tasks  updating project statuses, adding and assigning new tasks, sending out reminders, and so on, all the way from project kickoff to sign-off.
The manual workload increases as your team grows, but with Notion these tedious tasks can become database automations you set and forget.
In this guide, well show you how to use database automations to set up custom workflows to streamline your processes and make sure nothing slips through the cracks.

##########################################

## How database automations save time and let you focus on the bigger picture
Database automations consist of trigger events and the sequence of actions that follows. Youll set up triggers and subsequent actions which are based on changes within database properties. The automation is structured as follows: When any of these occur (a trigger), do this (an action).
So, for example, your trigger could be when a new page is added to the database, and the resulting actions might fill up some properties with your chosen responses.

##########################################

Database automations can complete or update properties,add or edit pages in another database, send Slack notifications, and more. You can customize automations as needed and have several running in the same database for different scenarios.
While this feature is available in any Notion database, its uniquely powerful in the context of project management, where you need accurate workflows where nothing gets lost, missed, or forgotten.

##########################################

By creating database automations, you can:
- Reduce wasted time between tasks Instead of your team members waiting around to be assigned their next project, theyll be notified whenever something new lands on their plate.
- Prevent human error When your team is juggling multiple projects, its often the manual tasks (like re-assigning a task) that get forgotten. Setting up automations will reduce everyones cognitive load and prevent anything from getting missed.
- Consolidate project management Because database automations are native to Notion, you dont need to create complex workflows using third-party tools. You can do all your project management in Notion to keep your team focused and reduce context-switching.

##########################################

Database automations are only available on some plan types
Click to expand
## Set up workflows for your tasks and projects
You can set up database automations in a few simple steps.

##########################################

In your projects or tasks database:
- Go to the options menu  and selectAutomationsor just click on the lightning bolt icon.
- ChooseNew automationand rename it if you wish.
- Next, select your triggers, which can be when a new page is added, a certain property (or properties) are edited, orAny propertyis edited. Triggers are formatted as or statements, so if any one of the triggers occurs, the automation will occur.
- Choose the resulting actions, such as adding a new page to this database or another database, editing a property (in this database or another), send a Slack notification.
- ClickCreateto save the automation.
Anytime you want to edit your automations, come back to the menu and make your changes.

## Three automations for Notion Projects
Ready to start building your own automations?
Here are some helpful examples to try out in your projects and tasks databases.
### 1. Start a new task
Every time you add a new task to your database, you can assign that task to someone, send them a notification, and give it the correct status.
To do this, create a new task and call it something like New task flow. Go to+ Add triggerand select+ Page added.

##########################################

In the+ Add actionmenu, give all new pages the statusNot Started, and select a team member to assign them to. Finally, click Send Slack notification to and choose who you want to notify.
Now, whenever you add a new task, youll see all those properties are completed, and a Slack notification is sent.

### 2. Kick off a project
To simplify the process of kicking off a project, you can create aProject kickoffautomation in your Projects database.
The trigger will be when a projects status is changed fromNot startedtoPlanning, and the actions that follow will automatically schedule a project kickoff meeting and notify the project manager.

##########################################

In the Actions menu, selectAdd page toand find the meeting notes database. Call the new pageProject Kickoffand clickEdit another propertyto tag all team members and set the meeting date toToday, which will be the current date whenever the workflow is triggered. Finally, we can send a Slack notification to the project manager to alert them that the project is about to kick off.

##########################################

### 3. Send an email when a form is filled out
Imagine you have a company Help Desk database with a form that allows employees to submit requests directly. You want to notify the assignee every time someone fills out that form. Here's how to set this up in a few simple steps:
- Click the lightning bolt icon and select+ New automation
- In the trigger section, choosePage added
- From the list of actions, selectSend mail to...and customize the email content
That's it! Now, whenever someone submits a new request, the assignee will receive an email notification. For more details on connecting Gmail, check out ourhelp center article.
Use "@" to mention specific pages, people, or properties in email actions

##########################################

## Automate complexity away with formulas
Sometimes, simple "if-then" statements just don't cut it when you're trying to make your database sing. Let's say you want to set up an automation that assigns new bugs to the on-call engineer. Sounds simple, right? Well, here's where it gets a bit tricky  your on-call rotation is tracked in a separate database. Now you need to connect data from two different sources to make this work. It's not as straightforward as you might think  you might need to combine a few data points to kick off the final action.

##########################################

This is where formula-based automations shine. They offer multiple ways to customize your task flow that wouldn't otherwise be possible. These automations can easily connect information from different databases or use date-specific variables (like date and time calculations) to streamline your workflow. The best part? You can focus on important work while Notion automatically handles the complex stuffupdating statuses, assigning tasks, or crunching numbers for reports.
### Getting started
Formula-based automations shine when it comes to creating custom actions that pull information from other pages or properties. They're also great for automations that need to read from different databases.

##########################################

Here's how to set up a formula-based automation:
- Click the lightning bolt icon at the top of your database.
- Hit the+to create a new automation.
- Add your first trigger.
- After that, selectDefine variablesto start configuring your formula-based automation.

### Setting up a formula-based automation
Now that you're familiar with the basics, let's explore an example! Imagine you're running a company help desk and want to send a Gmail notification to your submitter every time your team resolves a ticket.

##########################################

Here's how to set it up:
- Set up your main trigger First, make sure you have your main trigger set up. In this case, set your trigger toStatusasComplete. Then, enable an action every time the status is set to complete. To do this, head to the "Do" section and chooseSend mail tofrom the actions list.
Add a personal touch to your Gmail notification
Click to expand
- Add the formula-based automation ClickAdd actionand thenDefine variablesto start building out your custom automation.
The goal of your formula is to:1)let submitters know their ticket is resolved and2)tell them when it was resolved. Here's a formula you could use:
"Your ticket"+ Trigger page +"has been resolved at"+ Time triggered

##########################################

Let's break down this formula:
- "Your ticket" This kicks off our friendly message.
- +signs  These combine the different parts of our message.
- Trigger page This points to the specific ticket that started the automation.
- "has been resolved at" This gives context to what's happening.
- Time triggered This tells us when the ticket was closed.
Youre overall set up should look something like this:
And there you have it! When you put it all together, you get a warm, personal message. It lets the person who submitted the ticket know their issue is resolved and when it was taken care of.

##########################################

It might take some practice, but once you get the hang of it, formula-based automations open up a world of possibilities. You can create more granular actions that grow with your workflow, saving you from clunky workarounds that eat up your time.
## More database automations for all your work
There are infinite ways to build efficient workflows across your entire workspace with database automations.
Want some more inspiration?
Here are more suggestions for ways to use database automations in your personal and professional life - with helpful templates to get started.

##########################################

- Add closing dates to your sales pipeline When you mark a deal asClosedin yourSales Pipeline, automatically set theDate closedproperty to today, and send a notification to your#saleswinsSlack channel.
- Assign an interviewer for new candidates In your companysApplicant Tracker, an automation will tag the engineering team lead asInterviewerwhenever you add a new candidate for the engineering team. You can create similar automations for other teams.
- Mark courses youre currently enrolled in When you add a new course to the Courses database in yourAssignment Tracker, theCurrenty enrolledproperty will automatically be checked off.
- Mark started and finished dates on your reading list CompleteStartedandCompleteddates for all books you read and organize in yourReading List.

# Who should be a workspace member, and who should be a guest?
A collaborative workspace where everyone has the right access to the content is the modern way of working. However, as an admin, you want to allocate your teams budget responsibly and avoid using more paid seats than you need, while still ensuring everyone has the right tools to do their job.
Understanding the difference between members and guests will help you decide who you should invite to join your workspace.
This guide will explain:
- Key differences between members and guests in your workspace
- Who should be a member, and who should be a guest
- How to manage member and guest settings

##########################################

## Members are part of your organization
Members are most likely to be people from your organization wholl have access to the majority of the content in the workspace.
People at your company need to become workspace members so they can effectively collaborate, share content, create and edit pages, and access all the information relevant to their role.

##########################################

Members can:
- Have workspace-wide access They will have some level of access to the majority of content, even if its only to read or comment, except for private content and any pages that have been restricted.
- Belong to groups and teamspaces You can add workspace members to groups and invite them to teamspaces. Members can also join any open teamspaces. Inside a teamspace, members can easily find information relevant to their role and create docs alongside their team mates.
- Create new pages and teamspaces Members can create pages in any area they have access to, and add new teamspaces.
- Work on private pages Members have aPrivatesection in the sidebar where they can create private pages. When theyre ready to share more broadly, all they have to do is move these pages to the right teamspace.
- Share pages and adjust page settings Sharing pages with people or groups and publishing pages to the web is possible for members with full access.

##########################################

There are different types of Notion workspace members:
- Workspace owners can manage workspace settings, delete a workspace, and manage fellow admins, members, and guests.
- Membership admins only exist on Enterprise plans. They can add or remove members to the workspace or groups but do not have access to workspace settings.
- Members are the rest of your colleagues who can create and edit Notion pages but dont have access to workspace settings.
Teamspaces help teams organize important work
Click to expand
### Who should become a workspace member?
There are a few things to consider when deciding whether to make someone a workspace member.

##########################################

Firstly, youll be billed per member on paid plans. So, you dont want to pay a members seat for someone who only works with you on a short-term or project basis.
Instead, members should be people wholl need to regularly sign in and access a lot of workspace content.

##########################################

Examples of workspace members include:
- Everyone on your team Make everyone on your team a member so they can access wikis, tasks, and work collaboratively to plan and execute projects.
- Your manager, and their manager Managers should be workspace members so they can have full visibility into their teams work and wider company goals and initiatives.
- Your agency partners Long-term partners can become members, however they may only need access to one teamspace, not the entire workspace.
- Long-term contractorsYou may want to invite some contractors and freelancers to become members if they work with you long-term and need access to several different areas of the workspace.
- Temporary staff and interns Depending on their scope of work, temporary staff and interns might need to become members. You can remove them from the workspace when their contract finishes.

##########################################

How to add members to your workspace
Click to expand
## Guests are collaborators working on specific projects
Guests will likely be external collaborators who arent employees of your organization, working with you on specific projects, often on a short-term basis.
Youll invite guests to the workspace on a page-by-page basis, and they wont have access to the entire workspace.
When you invite a guest to a page, they can view sub-pages automatically. However, you can adjust the settings of these pages to restrict access if needed.
Guests cant:
- Create pages outside the content theyre invited to They can only create sub-pages nested in the shared page.
- Join teamspaces or groups You cant add a guests to groups or invite them to a teamspace.

##########################################

Guests in your workspace might include:
- Freelancers and contractors In most cases, you wont need to add freelancers and contractors as members, because theyll probably only need access to limited content which you can add to a shared page.
- Clientsof your agencyInviting clients to your workspaces as guests is a convenient way to share projects and drafts. You can create a client portal home page which contains everything theyll need to review.
- A mentor, coach or family member If you want feedback on a document, such as your personal development plan, you could invite a friend or mentor to view the page as a guest.

##########################################

### Invite guests to your workspace by sharing pages with them
If you want to share a page with a guest, you can go to theSharemenu on the page you want to share.
ClickInvite, enter the email address of the person you want to invite, choose their access level, and selectInvite.
The guest will then receive an email with a link to the page.
If you want to adjust your guests access level, you can return to theSharemenu and select an option from the dropdown.
### Manage guest permissions
In theMemberssection ofSettings & members, youll see a tab forGuests.
Here, youll find all the pages each guest has access to. You can convert guests to members and remove them from the workspace here.

##########################################

Yourplanlimits the number of guests you can invite, so remember to remove guests who no longer need access.
## Who can invite a guest?
Workspace owners can adjust invite settings in the Security section of the workspace settings. Here, you can choose whether members can invite guests directly, via guest request, or completely disable guests.
If guest requests are enabled, Workspace owners will be able to invite guests directly, but everyone else will have to create a guest request and wait for this to be approved by a Workspace owner.
Workspace owners can enable guest requests to have more control over who views company content, and to ensure the workspace doesnt surpass its guest limit.

# A project management system for your design team that connects all your work
A solid project management system gives designers more time to do impactful work. Instead of worrying about checkins and checkpoints and checkboxes, your team can spend time actually, you know, designing.
Here, we'll show you step-by-step how to build aproject management systemtailored specifically to designers in Notion.We've seen it work across dozens of design teams. They're using it to take cross-functional projects to completion, foster tighter feedback loops and lead to a better end product for users.
Better databases have arrived!

##########################################

While the concepts outlined in this guide are still useful, references to specific product actions may be a bit outdated! Databases were redesigned in March 2022, so your experience may differ slightly from whats pictured and described here.This guideoutlines the new database features, including what's changed.
### In this piece, you'll learn
- 1To create a database for project management and roadmapping that's efficient and transparent.
- 2To organize this database with tags and views so you can quickly find what you need.
- 3Best practices from the Notion design team for supreme project management.

##########################################

## Soon, you'll be able to create a project management system for all things design that looks like this:
Your design team needs a system to manage its projects
From a project management standpoint, designers face a unique set of problems.

##########################################

- Too many tools it's easy to lose files, re-do work and waste time when designers need to turn over many rocks to find the one thing they need.
- Processes get inconsistent from problem to ideation to multiple drafts, your team is devaluing their design work if steps are missed and edge cases aren't considered. This is especially critical as your team grows.
- Many voices in feedback loops design teams work cross-functionally, and if there isn't a place to collect and act on feedback, it gets lost and other teams feel as though their opinions aren't taken into account.
In Notion, you can create a project management system that is completely customizable for your team's needs.

##########################################

- All tools, project work and feedback in one place in Notion pages, you can embed Figma and Framer prototypes, Invision designs, images, video and more. Plus, comments and discussions happen in these pages. So along with tracking project statuses, everything relevant to that project has a home, which means your team can quickly access it.
- Establish a process and track every step of a project from simple logo development to complex overhauls of your entire design system, you can create a process that works for your team, and every project can be moved from one stage to the next with complete visibility.
- Surface only relevant information with many steps and nuanced processes, there can be a lot of noise when managing every single aspect of a design project. Notion lets you slice the same database many different ways, so you can see projects by designer or what's launching this week (or however else you want to see it).

##########################################

So, how does this help your team?
Notion enables your design team to grow by setting a consistent process that still maintains quality work  all while fostering a culture of transparency.
## Setting up your design team's project management system
Projects large and small  and all the teams contributing to these projects  can live in your one project management system. Here's how to set it up, with recommendations specific to designers.
### 1. One database tracks every initiative
There are a handful of different databases you can make in Notion: tables, calendars, lists, boards, etc. Here, we'll focus on a board  this is a collection of individual project pages you can move from one stage of your process to the next.

##########################################

- Hit/to see a menu of everything you can add to a Notion page. This is called the "slash command," and it's the starting place for just about everything you do in Notion.
- To make a board, type/boardand chooseBoard - Full page. You'll make a new page that's just your board.
- You'll see columns at the top of your board. These will be steps in your design process. Go ahead and change them to whatever you'd like  for example, "Not started," "Next up," "In progress," and "Completed."
- You'll also see cards, which will be home to your design projects. Click one and you'll see properties at the top. Click+ Add a propertyto begin adding your own (and select what type of property you want). You can add things like the lead designer, designate a project as mobile or desktop, and a launch date. These are important because you'll be able to organize your board based on these properties.
- Grab a card and move it from one column to the next. Ah...no better feeling than progress.

Each part of the board serves a purpose in your design project management system.Columns will help you establish a process everyone follows. Cards will become design projects, like that typography redesign you've been meaning to do. And inside those cards will be everything you need for each project.
With everything in one place, designers can stop bouncing between apps  instead, focusing on the work at hand.
### 2. Customize your database
Using Notion, you can make a database that matches your team's workflow. Here are some tips for designers setting up their project management system.

##########################################

- Add properties to your cards inside your board's cards, you'll see properties. These are attributes you'll assign to each card, like the type of project or the designer responsible for it. Click on a property and you'll see a menu for thePROPERTY TYPE. Use aPersonproperty to assign a designer (or project owner). Use aSelectproperty and call it "Type" to denote the type of project, like ads, web or mobile. Use aDateproperty to select a ship date. You can add or remove as many properties as you'd like  so as your team changes or your process evolves, Notion grows with you.
- Show properties on your cards to get a 10,000 ft. view of all the types of projects your team is working on, who's executing them, and their statuses, display certain properties directly on your cards. That way, you'll be able to see them in the board view (instead of needing to click into the specific card). At the top right of your table, hitand selectProperties. You'll then be able to toggle the properties you want to see in the board view. You can even grab theicon to re-order how they're shown on the cards.
- Change the grouping of your board instead of seeing projects by their status, you might want to see them by priority, or see how many projects each designer has on their plate. On the upper right of your board, you'll see aGroup bybutton. This changes the columns in the board to any property that's aSelect,Multi-selectorPerson.
- Create different views Notion allows you to view the same dataset many ways. Maybe you want to see all the projects related to landing pages, or maybe you want a calendar of launch dates. To do this, hit+ Add a viewnext to the title of your table, select the type of database you want, give it a name and hitCreate. You can then apply different filters and sorts to customize it further. Let's say you want a list of all the mobile projects your designers are working on. Create a list view, then selectFilterand then+ Add a filter. If you have a property that denotes the type of design work, choose "Mobile and now, only mobile projects will be in your list. You can also selectSort, then+ Add a sort. Here, you can organize cards by priority, due date and more.

With this project management system, you're essentially creating a multi-tool that's customizable to meet your design team's needs. It's one database that can be used for many different purposes  from a list organizing all your landing page designs, to a calendar that shows when those designs will launch.

### 3. All project info, right inside your project management system
Since you now have the framework for managing projects, let's explore how each page can help you collect and organize all the work related to your projects.

##########################################

Like artists, designers use a unique combination of tools to get the job done. Notion consolidates them. No need to juggle design tools and the project management software just to get one thing done.

##########################################

- Custom pages for every project designers on your team probably work differently. No matter. The body of every Notion page can be used however they want, while still living inside the structure of your project management system. By typing/headingyou can create headers to neatly organize info, making it easy to find and understand. You can drag-and-drop anything using theicon, like images, text, videos, whatever. Consider making columns for an even cleaner look by dragging blocks all the way to the right.
- Embeds just for designers Notion allows you to embed many different types of files right into your project pages. Of course, there's videos, images and PDFs. But you can also embed Figma or Invision projects to see live drafts of website mockups. Collaborate with the UX team on an app redesign by embedding Framer prototypes. In the final review of a logo change, an embedded Whimsical or Miro board could have a flowchart showing your designer's thought process. Access these by simply typing/and the name, like/figmaor/miro.
- Feedback from all teams in one place design work is so cross-functional, you may be collaborating with engineers or getting approval from the head of marketing. Use the@symbol to mention one of your teammates and keep the feedback loop tight. This can be done at the top of any page by hovering over the title and clickingAdd discussion, or you can hover over any block to bring up theicon, and hitCommentfrom that menu. Collecting feedback from other pieces of software is difficult, leaving important thoughts on the studio floor. Notion busts the silos between teams while organizing relevant feedback from everyone in one place, making it actionable.

##########################################

Watch this 4-minute video for everything on comments and discussions.
- Iterations give decisions full context you can see what went into every design decision because drafts and commentary for that project are organized in one place. If you want to resurface a version of that mobile dropdown menu, or understand why the brand color changed from purple to periwinkle, you have a full field of vision from start to end of every single project.
This project management system pulls double duty, keeping your projects organized while centralizing all the work related to every project. Time spent hunting for information is reallocated to your craft.

##########################################

### 4. A template for every design process
Set your designers off on the right foot by using templates  page formats that you can recreate inside your project management system with a single click.
Whether it's a project kickoff or retrospective, templates help your designers approach problems with the same set of criteria.Even broader, templates can help new designers get up to speed on your team's philosophy and provide important decision-making context for veterans and newbies alike.

##########################################

On the right side of your board, click the down arrow next to the blueNewbutton and select+ New template. A blank page will appear. Here's where you'll create the template once so you can use it over and over again (you can also edit it, as your design process morphs).

##########################################

For designers specifically, here are a few ideas for templates:
- Project kickoff under an "Overview"H2header, you can haveH3headers for "Problem Statement" and "Proposed Work." Then, under anH2header for "Scope," you can haveH3headers for "Requirements," "Timeline" and "Future Work." One thing we like to do is include prompts under these headers in a different color. Under "Proposed Work," you can write a sentence that says, "High-level overview of what we're building and why we think it will solve the problem." Change its color by clicking theicon and selectingColorfrom the menu.

##########################################

- Design spec when sharing a mockup with your design team, using a template can ensure edge cases are considered and appropriate feedback is gathered. In the template, you can use aSelectproperty to denote the type of work you're doing: "Spec." You can even include other properties, likeDatefor proposed launch date or aPersonto tag reviewers. In the body of the template, createH3headers that give your team a space to embed the design, leave feedback, and outline next steps.

##########################################

- Client presentation if you're at an agency, you can share Notion pages with clients. This collates feedback into one place, instead of your designers digging through emails or Figma comments. IncludeH2headers that neatly organize your design work, necessary context, and give clients a place for feedback. You can even include aTextproperty titled "Summary" and give clients the one-sentence rundown of the project's status. Then, when you're ready to share it, selectSharefrom the top right of the page and toggleShare to the web. From the dropdown menu, toggleAllow comments, which will give your clients the ability to comment on your work. Then you're ready to hitCopy linkand send it off.

##########################################

### 5. Best practices from Notion designers
Sam Baldwin is new to Notion's design team and from day one, he's been contributing. He says, "Notion's project management system enabled me to quickly get up to speed with all the projects, priorities, and a sense of what everyone is working on. A shared tasks board promotes an open, transparent way of working. Anyone can weigh in on current projects or offer feedback, leading to better outcomes."

##########################################

Here are a few tips we've learned from our own design project management system:
- Linking project management systems between teams if yourengineering teamis using Notion to organize their projects, you can link your two systems together so no one ever misses a beat.Add aRelationproperty to templates or pages in your board. Then search for your engineering team's project management database. So, if you're redesigning your website's homepage, you can link all the engineering tasks associated with that project, like code reviews and UX updates.You can use aRelationproperty to connectmeeting notestoo. No matter where other tasks or meeting notes are located in Notion, you can collect everything for a project in one place to help your team work more efficiently.

- Pages where designers see only their tasks many designers use individual pages to manage their own work. Inside these pages, you can link a specific view of your team-wide project management board. When a designer updates a task in their personal view, it's reflected in the team-wide project management board (and vice-versa).Type/linkand selectCreate linked database. Search for your project management system and it'll appear right in that designer's page.Then+ Add a view, using aFilterto surface only your tasks. This helps you focus while still working toward overall goals. You can also do this in yourdesign wiki, creating a view that shows only projects in motion this week.

* Then+ Add a view, using aFilterto surface only your tasks. This helps you focus while still working toward overall goals. You can also do this in yourdesign wiki, creating a view that shows only projects in motion this week.
- Tags or views for projects that are open for feedback since Notion fosters transparency and collaboration between teams, we've created a tag that lets teammates know we'd like their opinions.In your project management board, create aSelectproperty called "Feedback," and make one of the tags "RFC" (request for comment).When you're kicking off a project or just mocked up a spec, you can tag the page RFC and circulate it with the entire team on Slack. That way, you can crowdsource feedback to make designs even stronger.

# Connect projects and docs to get more done, faster
If your team is using one tool to manage projects and another for documentation, productivity suffers. Team members frequently switch tools to search for relevant information, which interrupts their flow and reduces efficiency.
Instead of paying for several specific tools, why not consolidate all your work into a single place?
In Notion,project managementis connected to the docs, notes, wikis and knowledge that support your work, so you always understand whos doing what - and why.
In this guide, well show you how to use our Projects & tasks databases to manage your teams workload and move projects forward. Youll learn how automation and Notion AI can help you breeze through repetitive work.

##########################################

## A ready-made project management system for your team
To start managing your projects and tasks in Notion, head over to theTemplatesmenu in your sidebar, findProjects & tasks, and duplicate the template into your workspace.
Youll now find the two databases available in your workspace. Heres a quick overview of what you can do with them:
- Look at your projects and tasks in different ways Each database has different, helpful views, filtered and sorted to show sub-sets of information. For example, you can view only ongoing projects or see all projects on a timeline. There are also board layouts where you can update task or project status with a simple drag and drop.

##########################################

- Identify blockers preventing a project from moving forwardTheBlockingproperty in your projects database lets you mark a project that must be completed before another one can begin, so you can better prioritize your workload.
- Split large tasks into sub-tasks Use the sub-task and dependencies properties on your Tasks database to break tasks into manageable steps and get granular about what needs to be done.
- Add tasks to corresponding projects Projects and tasks are connected via a relation property. This means as you add new tasks, you can connect them to their corresponding project.
- Visualize how close projects are to completionDisplay the project completion percentage as a progress bar or ring so you know how much work is left. This rollup property calculates how many related tasks are marked Done. Learn more about relations and rollupshere.
- Plan your teams sprints in Notion If you select Projects, tasks & sprints from the template gallery, youll get a third database where you can plan your sprints and assign tasks to each new sprint. Learn more about sprint planninghere.

##########################################

Import your projects and tasks
If you already track tasks in another tool (or collaborate with teams that use different tools), import your work into Notion to give everyone full transparency.

- Import your entire project management system from Asana to Notion with our importer tool  learn morehere.

## A flexible project tracker tailored to your team
Notion databases are totally flexible, and you can customize the properties and layout of each database to adapt them to your teams unique workflow.
To add a new property to the database, go to themenu, clickProperties, then+ New property.

##########################################

Here are some suggested properties for your projects and tasks databases.

##########################################

- Add a brief description of the project or taskProviding an overview of a project or task with theDescriptionproperty means everyone can understand whats involved from just a glance at the database.
- Tag collaborators separately from owners Use theCollaboratorsproperty to tag everyone else involved in a project, making clear whos leading the initiative and whos contributing to it.
- Estimate the work involved in a task to distribute them evenly among your teamSome tasks are more demanding than others. With theEstimatesproperty, you can score tasks according to the amount of work involved. Use the t-shirt sizing (S -XL) method, points, or devise your own scoring system.
- See how competing tasks intersect in timeline viewTheDependenciesproperty (only visible in timeline view) lets you visibly connect tasks that block other tasks.

##########################################

As well as adding new properties, you can create several custom database views. For example, you could create filtered views to show all tasks assigned to you or projects you are collaborating on. You can also sort the Task database by due date, priority, project, or created date.
Projects are powered by databases
Learn more about database views, filters, and sortshere.
### Connect projects & tasks to meetings, docs, and more
NotionsRelationproperty lets you build a 2-way connection between one database and another. Projects and Tasks are already related, which is why you can assign tasks to a project and see project completion rate, according to how many tasks have been done.

##########################################

Build more connections throughout your workspace by relating projects and tasks to other databases. This makes it easier to find relevant information and keep the context behind your work in easy reach.
To add a new database relation, selectRelationin the+ New propertymenu. Select the database you want to connect, and toggleShow on...if you want the relation property to appear on the other database.
For example, you could relate your projects database to your meeting notes to quickly resurface relevant meeting notes on a project page, without needing to search for them.
Or, create a relation with your docs database to access helpful documentation like feature specs, PRDs, or RFCs from your project page.

##########################################

Everyone working on the project will quickly find supporting information, and understand why their work matters.
## Simplify and automate workflows for your team
Often, the most repetitive tasks slow down teams and hamper progress.
Instead of manually adding new tasks to do, updating statuses, and writing project briefs from scratch, you can dramatically accelerate your work using automation.
Notions repeating templates and buttons can reduce manual tasks and simplify complex workflows for everyone.

##########################################

### Use repeating templates for work you do all the time
You can create templates inside any database. Go to the dropdown next toNew, select+ Add new template, and customize the page with all the relevant information every time you recreate a particular kind of doc.
If you need to recreate a particular template regularly, you can turn your template into a repeating template. To do this, click themenu next to the template, then chooseRepeat. You can then configure how often you want a new entry to appear in the database  daily, monthly, etc.
This is handy for recurring tasks like writing your weekly newsletter, daily social posts, or admin tasks.
Repeating templates can supercharge routine work
Read all about repeating templateshere.

##########################################

### Complete a lengthy workflow with the click of a button
Create a button anywhere in your workspace to insert blocks to the page, add entries to a database, or edit pages in a database. Buttons can do several actions at once, meaning you can condense a complex process down to a single click.
To add a button, open the/menu and selectButton. Next, configure the button and add all the steps you require.

##########################################

You could use buttons to:
- Submit an urgent design request in one click Configure your button to add an entry to your design teams request database, and add a second step to set the Priority property on the new page to Urgent.
- Simplify the bug-reporting process You can make it easier for your team to report bugs by adding a button where anyone can submit a bug to your engineering teams bug-tracking database. Automatically complete properties  setDate reportedto todays date andReported byto whoever clicks the button.

##########################################

- Perform triage on your overdue tasks Create a button that assigns all overdue tasks to the person who clicks the button. This can help you catch up on overdue work and lets everyone know whos responsible for completing those tasks.
Learn all about buttons

## Projects powered by AI
Notion has a built-in AI assistant to help with whatever you need, without breaking your flow by switching to another tab.
Use Notion AI to generate all kinds of text, and even automatically complete database properties to cut down repetitive work.

##########################################

### Create anything you can imagine with Notion AI
With Notion AI, you can write and edit text, expand your thinking through brainstorming, create an action plan to achieve any goal, and much more.
Youll be able to automate tedious, repetitive tasks, and create documentation in a fraction of the time, freeing up your team free to focus on important work.
To open the Notion AI menu, hit the spacebar on a new line. From there, you can choose from options like writing with AI, generating content from information on the page, brainstorming ideas, outlining a doc, and more. You can also just start typing a custom prompt.

##########################################

Here are just a few ways you could use Notion AI to glide through project management:
- Complete project briefs in minutes Notion AI can outline a project and complete the brief with a few follow-up prompts. Youll be able to draft an entire project brief from scratch in a fraction of the time it usually takes.
- Get an overview of a doc with an AI-generated summary By adding an AI-generated summary to documents, you can help team members get up to speed without reading an entire page from start to finish. You can add a Summary block to the top of any page or just ask Notion AI to summarize the content.

##########################################

- Extract action items from any page After a project kickoff meeting, you can ask Notion AI to review the meeting notes and surface action items. Youll instantly catch any tasks to be done and get them into your tasks database so nothing gets missed.
- Draw up a roadmap for completing a project  You knowwhatyou want to achieve but nothowto get there. Why not ask Notion AI to help you plan your project roadmap? You can brainstorm all the steps needed to complete your project successfully.

##########################################

### Work faster with AI autofill
Add an AI autofill property to your projects and tasks databases to automatically fill out text properties on new database entries. This will further reduce repetitive work and ensure you dont end up with database entries that only contain partial information.
Go to New property in the database properties menu and selectFill with AI.
Now you can choose from the following options how you want Notion AI to complete the property:
- Automatically summarize the database entryIf you selectSummary, Notion AI will automatically produce a summary of the page content and display it as a property. This summary updates as the page content changes, giving everyone a real-time overview of how a project is progressing.

##########################################

- Surface key info in the database viewExtract insights using theExtract key infoAI prompt which will highlight actions to do or the main takeaways from the database page.
- Design a custom prompt for your property You can also build a custom prompt telling Notion AI exactly what you want to display. Try asking AI to generate a user story for a task, list potential risks that might block progress on a task, or summarize the key results, goals, or metrics associated with a project.

Your sidebar just got better
While the information presented in this guide is still useful, some elements of the sidebar have been updated  making sharing with the right groups easier. Learn about howteamspaces give every team a home for their important work.

##########################################

# Automatically generate blocks, pages and more with the click of a button
Maybe you spend a lot of time creating and editing pages in Notion, adding text, lists, database entries, editing their properties and more. Maybe you even build frameworks and teach others how to use them.
Now, imagine if you could automate and simplify those repetitive tasks and do multiple things at once - literally with the click of a button?
Instead of painstakingly configuring third party automation tools, you can place buttons anywhere in your workspace to generate content, create pages, edit database entries and show confirmation dialogs.

##########################################

Using buttons for request systems and complicated processes can streamline the workflow and save time for everyone - whether theyre new to Notion or a seasoned power user.
In this guide, well explain how to create and configure buttons, and examples of ways you can use them.
## How to create and configure buttons
To create a button, open the/menu and selectButton. This will open a configuration window where youll be prompted to choose what you want your button to do.
If you want to insert blocks into the page, chooseInsert blocksand then start adding content in the box by hitting the/command and choose from text, lists, images, embeds, databases, and more.

##########################################

Once youve added your blocks, clickDone, and your button will appear on the page. Click it to reproduce those blocks whenever you need them.
Convenient, right? But there aremany morethings your button can doincluding a combination of several actions.
If you want to change the button action or add more steps, go to theConfigureicon next to the button, and either...next to your current action, or+ Add another stepbelow.
Lets take a more in-depth look at how each function works.

##########################################

### Insert any kind of blocks into your page
TheInsert blocksaction will add content into the same page where you create the button. You can add as many blocks as you want, from simple toggles to full page templates, and pre-fill information your team needs for a recurring task.
This could help you

##########################################

- Spin up a checklist for your team Insert a To-do list where the items will always be the same, such as a checklist for marking a feature spec document as complete, or handing over a project.
- Write a content brief in minutes Configure your button to outline an article, so you can generate instructions, prompts, headers, notes, writing guidelines, and even placeholder images. Then, all you have to do is customize and assign it to a team member to complete.
- Develop your team wiki and workspace Put a Create new page button so you can quickly add new pages to expand your knowledge base. You can pre-populate the page's required parts so its easy to complete.

##########################################

## Make a button to create and edit database entries
You can use buttons to create new database entries and edit the properties of existing ones. This can help you streamline processes for newer Notion users and embed action steps in a document.
Database templates vs buttons
Your database templates let you create new items in a database based on a pre-designed format. With buttons, you can add or edit page properties in a database from anywhere in the workspace. Try using a button to create a page, and then a database template to populate the page's content.

##########################################

### Add a new database entry with a button
Lets say you want to create an Add new task button in your department home, so you can quickly add action items to the teams task database without leaving the page.
First, create a button and selectCreate page in a databasein the editor. Next toCreate page in, choose the database you want to add to - in this case, Tasks.
Next, go to theEdit a propertydropdown where you can choose one or more properties to automatically fill out. Since this is a new task, you could automatically set the Status property to To do or Not started. You may also want to assign the task to someone by default, or set an arbitrary due date, such as One week from today.

##########################################

You can use this to create new pages in any database, from your meeting notes and docs to your projects or client database.

##########################################

Here are some other ways to use this button:
- Report a bug to engineering team Your Go-to-Market team can flag bugs or issues for engineering to look without going to the bug tracker database.
- Add new product requirement document Your product team can instantly start a new PRD with a button. Create an outline prompting you to complete the who, what and why of the product, and automatically tag product team.
- Submit a design request If your content team needs a new graphic for a blog post, they can send a request straight to the design teams project database.
- Create a company update Whenever your People team need to send a company-wide update, the can create one with a button.

##########################################

### Edit properties in an existing database page
A button can help you simultaneously update properties for all pages in a database, or all those that meet certain criteria.When you choose theEdit pages in databasefunction, select the database you want to edit.
Then, you can use a filter to choose the types of entries you want to edit, then you can choose the property you want to assign them.
For example, you could:
- Make a button to assign all overdue tasks to you Filter the database to show all tasks where the due date is on or before today. Then, choose the Assign property, and replace it with Person who clicked the button.  This could also be useful for an engineer taking over triage of recently reported bugs.
More about person properties

##########################################

"Person" is a dynamic property. When you select Person who clicked the button instead of your own name from the drop down, whoever clicks will be tagged. So, when someone clicks Assign tasks to me, they will be tagged.
- Let teammates mark a document as complete For a knowledge base article thats required reading, you can add a person property called Complete. Then, add a button at the end where people can tag themselves.
- Change the status of tasks Your button can edit the Status property of a task, so you can easily move a task, or group of tasks, from Up next to In progress.

##########################################

### Open a page as a preview or in full
When you add Open page as an action step, another page will open when you click the button. This could be the page youve created in a previous step, or another page of your choosing.
So for example, if youve created the Add new task button mentioned previously, you could go to+ Add another stepand choose Open page. Then you can selectPage createdto go straight to the new task youve just created.
An Add new page button could also have a second step to open the page thats just been created, so you can immediately jump in to editing.
You can decide whether you want to open as a full page, side peek or center peek.

##########################################

### Produce a pop-up confirmation window
Your button can generate a pop-up box offering two possible choices - to either continue or abandon the workflow.
This can be helpful for reinforcing process with your team members, and to ensure they are creating content intentionally.
For example, a pop-up could appear when someone attempts to assign tasks to themselves, saying Are you sure you want to assign all outstanding tasks to you?
Add confirmation dialog to your button
Open the button editor . Click + Add another step and choose Show confirmation dialog. You can then edit the text you want to appear.
## Other workflows you can create with buttons
Buttons are a powerful automation tool and theres no limit to how you can use them.

##########################################

They can help you create new content based on templates, or edit all similar database entries with a click.
By making your teams processes more efficient, you can scale your workflow and systems with ease.

##########################################

Want more inspiration for how to use buttons in your workspace? Here are some more ideas:
- Create a meeting agenda and notes If you have a shared page for 1:1s with a team member, you can create a New meeting button inside that page. Place questions, prompts and bullet points that you use for the meeting in the Insert blocks module. When its time for the meeting just click the button and youre ready to take notes.
- Mark a document as finished Use the Edit database properties action to mark the status of a document in your docs database as complete. You might add this button inside the document itself, to make it easy for your team members to update several properties at once - mark status as Done and fill out completed date as Today. You can even add another step to the button, which will create a new item in your tasks database for a manager to review the document.
- Request multiple items with one button You can make a button to request multiple actions once a project is launched. For example, by clicking the Launch button, you could add a post to the social media calendar, send a content request to the content calendar and change the project status to In Progress.

# Best practices for internal communications on Notion
Internal communication is extremely important for keeping high-performing teams aligned. As your team grows, it demands more structure, more thoughtful updates, and the intentional collection of cross-functional information. When it comes to internal communication, Notion can help you stay organized and make sure every team member is up to date on important company topics.
In this Guide we'll walk through some best practices for internal communications in Notion, and share some pro tips from the Notion Executive Operations team.

##########################################

## Create company-wide structures for sharing information
If teams dont have structure to their information, it may live in many places, making it hard for team members to stay up to date on company happenings  sometimes resulting in confusion or mistakes. Notion brings all your information together in one place, so you can save time searching for this information.

##########################################

We sat down with Cuyler Hirata, executive operations at Notion, to ask him how he thinks about internal communication on Notion. Reflecting on common pitfalls hes seen, he noted the following:
When the team is smaller it's pretty easy to know where everything is at all times, but as the org grows and more people are added and more docs and pages are created, I think that's when information can get lost. Setting up your structure early on will go a long way.
Heres some tips for ensuring people know where to access information.

- Be consistent as your company grows, you might have more people making announcements. In your docs database, you can create templates for each type of announcement you make. For example, your Company-wide announcement template might have sections for Context and Next steps to ensure all the edge cases are considered. And each type of template can be customized to the needs of the communication.
- Use shared databases for all types of communication make top-level pages in your sidebar for meeting notes and docs, ensuring everyone on your team knows where to go for updates. You can useSelectproperties to help designate the types of meetings (like Sales or All-hands) or the announcements that live in your docs database (like Process change).

##########################################

- Keep foundational pages in your company wiki while each team has their own wiki, your company can have a top-level page that organizes things like your mission, values, and more. At Notion,we use a company-wide operating system(OS) for these types of pages. This helps teammates new and old stay up-to-date on the companys most important philosophies.
- Create a playbook all new Notion employees receive our communications playbook, which outlines all our best practices. Whether its communication styles or expected response times, you can lay this information out for all employees so you establish a standard org-wide.

##########################################

As you grow your team or company, these systems will simplify project management, marketing, onboarding, and everything in between.
## Build pages with the reader in mind
The average attention span of an American adult is somewhere between 7 and 12 seconds, that means that a reader needs to be engaged immediately with an image, callout, or top-level heading. Using these on-page tools, you can structure information for your readers depending on the situation at hand.

##########################################

- Toggles toggles help get the main points across to everyone, and the details to those who need it. Toggles are great for adding additional methodology behind data points, or listing details in a multi-step plan. Simply type>to create the toggle, and drag information inside of it.
- Columns grab theto drag-and-drop any block in your page and move it to the right to create columns (the blue lines will help guide you). This creates a column, where you can put images alongside text for easy viewing.
- Callouts callouts can help bring attention to the most important portions of your document. Internally we often use these to describe what a section is all about and add structure to our documents.
- Visuals images, videos, and embeds are the first thing a reader notices on a page. Type/to see what you can include. Use these to highlight key points, metrics, or spotlight an important announcement or feature.
- Dividers type-three times in a row to create a divider under headers. This brings a nice visual break to your pages to separate information.
- Colors whether its the color of the text or the background behind it, bring a pop of color to certain sections of your pages that you really want to call attention to. Highlight a block or text and use theto navigate toColor.

##########################################

- Typeform embeds need to survey a group or receive feedback? Use the/Typeformblock or paste a link to the survey to embed surveys right inside of Notion.
The visual elements on the page come together to help you communicate information effectively. Because these pages are totally customizable, you can adjust them to the needs of that communication. Sometimes, itll be a quick update with a chart. Others will require more text and exposition. Its up to you!
## Get information in front of your teams
So youve organized your Notion and youre feeling great about availability of information  now what? Get information in front of your teams through intentional distribution efforts.

##########################################

Because Notion is so open and there's just so much available for folks to access there needs to be a bit of guidance and direction. That's why we brought about the bi-weekly newsletter. They're able to go in and really understand all of the key happenings from the past couple of weeks.
In addition to just meeting notes and announcements, you can also create company-wide updates using Notion (like Blinkists newsletter). This helps collect everything your teammates need to know in one place.

##########################################

Some inspiration for this type of communication includes:
- A monthly newsletter take time to highlight key information in and around your team. This is great for onboarding new employees too. You can even create a Gallery database and include images of your new hires to introduce them to the broader team.
- A weekly update you can share wherever if youre working on a project or need to update the team on the status of a process change, hit theCopy linkbutton in theSharemenu and send it out via Slack, email, or your team's platform of choice.
- Make a page public so external folks can stay up to date from investors to company friends, you can make a page public by toggling on that option in theSharemenu. This is helpful when youre working with partners outside your org who need to be aware of company happenings.

##########################################

- Link to Slack Channel you can connect every Notion update into a Slack channel using the Connect a Slack Channel feature.

## Making it stick
The simpler your communications are, the easier it will be for readers to find and know where to expect information, and the easier it will be to manage. For this, we recommend finding, creating and consistently using templates. There's a few types of templates in Notion, each with different use cases:
- Database Templates these are super powerful tools for robust communication systems. In the Notion "meeting notes" database, you'll find pre-created note structures for engineering syncs, user research, roadmapping, and more.Read about database templates here.
- Notion Template Gallery you can use this to find full page templates for your specific use case. Whether it's a team wiki, a company bulletin, or a personal vacation packing list, Notion's Template Gallery is a great place to start.
- The template button this is great for adding small updates to an ongoing list. For example, a weekly to do list, broken down by role, that doesn't require a new page each week.
- Synced Blocks you might have information that exists many places, like your company's mission statement. Before, whenever it was updated, you'd have to find all the places the mission was referenced and edit each individually. But now, with Synced Blocks, whenever you update the company mission, it's updated everywhere.

# Board view databases
- Boards in Notion are an effective tool for project management. They provide a visual and organized way to manage tasks, projects, or processes.Items can be organized into columns to visualize stages of a process or assignments.Each entry in a board appears as a card in a column, with an option to show a preview of the entry's content.Cards can be grouped by various properties and can be manually rearranged.

# Bring your codebase into context with Notion's GitHub integration
Your engineering teams bring ideas to life through tools like GitHubmanaging code, tracking issues, and collaborating on pull requests.But when different teams use separate toolsengineers in GitHub and others elsewhereimportant updates can get scattered and fall through the cracks. This creates a frustrating cycle of context switching and reduces time spent on actual development.
Notion's GitHub integration isn't just about convenience; it's about fostering a deeper connection between code and context. With this integration, your project roadmap, design specs, meeting notes, and even user feedback all exist in a dynamic relationship with the code itself.

##########################################

In this guide, you'll learn how to:
- Keep all your GitHub items and Notion tasks in one place no more switching between tools
- Create custom views and database relations using synced databases
- Give your whole team visibility into development progress, even if they don't use GitHub
- Get quick insights into your codebase and Notion workflows using Notion AI
## Connect, track, and manage GitHub tasks in Notion
Imagine you're working on a project to boost your mobile app's UI experience. You want to keep your team in the loop about what's happening with your issues and pull requests, but you don't want to spend time switching between tools or sending constant updates. Let's walk through how to create a more connected workspace-

##########################################

Set up your GitHub integration
Click to expand
### Connect GitHub issues and pull requests to your Notion database
First, let's add a GitHub pull request (PR) property to your database. This connects your Notion pages to GitHub issues and PRs. Here's how
- Navigate to the+sign at the top right of your Notion database toadd a new property.
- Then, pickGitHub Pull Requestsfrom the connections list.
Once enabled, you can paste relevant pull requests into this field. The best part? Any updates to a GitHub pull request (PR) sync instantly to Notion, so your whole team stays in the loop without any extra work.

##########################################

### Automate GitHub updates in Notion with Magic Keywords
Just like with GitHub, you can usemagic keywordsin your Notion tasks too. These special keywords in your pull request descriptions automatically linkand even change the status ofissues. This streamlines your workflow and keeps everything organized.
Here's how it works
- When your PR description includes magic words like 'referring to' or 'relates to' a task, it automatically creates a link between the PR and the Notion task. This saves you from manually copying and pasting GitHub PR links into Notion to create relations.
- Similarly, if your PR description uses magic words associated with closing or finishing a task, the Notion task will be marked as done when the PR is merged.

##########################################

Create a prefixed unique ID property

### Keep context in sync with comments and backlinks
GitHub comments help you and your team ask questions, share ideas and discuss code. And since these discussions often shape important project decisions, you can now bring them right into your Notion pages  keeping all your context in one place.
- To enable this, click on the GitHub property in your database and selectEdit property.
- Then, turn onActivity Comments.
Notion also automatically adds backlinks from your Notion tasks to GitHub. To toggleLinkbacks in GitHubon or off, click the GitHub Pull Request property in your database and selectEdit property.

##########################################

When someone comments on a pull request, that comment shows up automatically in your linked Notion page. This keeps stakeholders like your Product Manager in the loop about technical decisions without them having to leave their project planning view. Plus, other engineers can easily reference these discussions later when working on similar features.
## Create custom views and link related data with synced databases
Synced databaseslet you bring data from other platforms directly into Notion. These syncs update automatically, but keep in mind they're one-way only any changes need to happen in the original platform (in our case, GitHub) to show up in Notion.

##########################################

### Create custom views of GitHub pull requests and issues to manage workloads
Now that you've synced your GitHub issues and pull requests to your Notion database, you can set up custom views that match your workflow. For example, a project manager on your engineering team could create views filtered by engineer assignments or by issue status (open vs. closed).
To create a new view, click the+sign at the top right corner of your database. Here are some useful ways to customize your views

##########################################

- Add views based on assigneeYou can filter by the "Assignee" property to see all pull requests or issues assigned to specific team members. This makes it easy to track individual workloads and responsibilities.
- Add views based on issue statusYou can also filter by "Status" to see all open pull requests or issues that need review or closed pull requests ready to deploy. This helps identify bottlenecks and track overall progress in your development pipeline.
Depending on your team's needs, you may need to experiment with different combinations to find what works best. Custom views make it easy to track progressshowing you what's happening and who's working on what in a clear, simple way.

##########################################

### Track project updates alongside your GitHub pull requests with database relations
Database relationsin Notion act as bridges, letting you establish meaningful connections between GitHub pull requests and other important data like project roadmaps, tasks, and documentation.
Let's say you're managing an engineering team building a new e-commerce app. You want to keep track of all your GitHub issues and pull requests in one place, so everyone can stay aligned on progress right from your Notion project database. Here's how you can use database relations to keep everything connected

##########################################

- Map your projects to your issuesStart byadding athen link your projects database to your synced issues database. This allows you to easily connect relevant PRs and issues to each project.
- Connect your code to what matters Link each project to your company goals. This helps teams see how even small code changes contribute to the bigger picture, keeping everyone moving forward together.

Using database relations helps teams track dependencies between features and code changes while making it easier to find and reference important technical decisions.

##########################################

## Give your whole team visibility into development progress, even if they don't use GitHub
Plenty of organizations find it's more efficient to keep GitHub access mainly for developers, and then use Notion as the central spot for project updates. Even if you don't need direct access to GitHub, it can still be really valuable in a couple of ways
### Add rich context to your docs with GitHub mentions and link previews
Imagine you're sharing a project update about mobile cache improvements. You want to give stakeholders insight into the engineering work without drowning them in technical details. With Notion, you can add GitHub references to your docs that paint a clear picture of the work. Here are some simple ways to do this

##########################################

- Use link previews for pull requests and issues For example, you can preview an issue that tracks a bug fix in your technical docs, or show a pull request that implements a new feature in your product specs.
- Link your code right in your docsLike pull requests and issues, you can bring code snippets right into your Notion pages. This makes it easy to look at code together, explain how things work, or talk through changes. For example, grab apermalinkto specific lines of code from GitHub and add them to your troubleshooting guides to make them more useful.
Keep things simple with mentions

##########################################

### Help cross-functional stakeholders unlock value from GitHub insights
When GitHub updates automatically sync to your Notion workspace, you make it easy for cross-functional stakeholders to follow progress in one familiar place. Here's how teams can use this integration to work better together

##########################################

- Product support can respond faster to bug reports Product operations teams can track bug fix progress in their bug reports database, giving cross-functional partners real-time updates without disrupting engineering work.
- Product managers can time product announcements perfectlyProduct managers can get more visibility into development timelines by tracking feature progress through synced GitHub data. By following merged pull requests in their product launch database, they'll know exactly when features are ready to announce.
- Design can track UI changes from idea to implementation Designers can see exactly when their UI/UX updates move from concept to code by tracking pull requests in their Notion workspace. For instance, they can follow along as developers build that new navigation menu they designed, right from their design system database.

##########################################

## Get insights into your codebase and Notion workflows using Notion AI
- Get quick answers about your codeAsk Notion AI to help you understand technical docs and codebases. Try questions like "What's the structure of our login system?" or "Show me PRs for the login feature from last month."
- Keep everyone in the loopTeams can track development progress without interrupting engineers. For example, try "Give me a summary of open mobile app issues."
- Find what you need fastNotion AI can search through GitHub markdown files, READMEs, PRs, and issues from the past year. Just ask something like "What documentation changes did we make to the API last quarter?"

##########################################

By bringing GitHub updates directly into Notion, we're creating one place where everyone can stay in sync. Your developers can focus on writing great code instead of updating statuses, and everyone else gets visibility without switching tools or interrupting the engineering team. The result? A more efficient, collaborative workspace where both technical and non-technical team members stay alignedwithout any extra work.

# Build a docs-first culture with a beautiful team wiki, powered by a database
Clear, accurate documentation is the backbone of successful teams. When reliable information is readily available, team members can get on with their work instead of searching for information.
### Convert your teams homepage into a wiki where you can organize, tag and verify pages in an easy-to-navigate layout.
You need a documentation process where everyone can find the information they need, when they need it. And, when your teammates open a document they need to be sure of its accuracy.

##########################################

But with hundreds of documents circling around, it can be difficult to keep everything current and trustworthy. Folks waste time asking whether this project scope includes everything discussed on the last client call, or if the brand guidelines and onboarding processes are still up to date.
To make matters worse, its not clearwhothey should ask. So, team members ping the wrong person or just drop their questions into a Slack group.
In this guide, well show you why Notion is the perfect place to build a powerful team wiki which will be the single source of truth for relevant information.

##########################################

## Turn your companys knowledge into a powerful wiki
A wiki is a great way to organize company or team information. With everything laid out in pages and columns, its simple to navigate and aesthetically pleasing.You can quickly draw up a wiki using templates like theProduct wiki,Engineering wikiand more from theTemplate gallery. Or create a team wiki from scratch by adding a top level page in your teamspace and then nestling relevant sub-pages inside.
Create your team wiki with templates
Weve created wiki templates for yourproduct team,engineering team, and more which youll find in the template gallery. You can duplicate these and customize them for your team.

##########################################

A team wiki will include things like your standard operating procedures (onboarding, project planning, etc), guides and training materials, key information about benefits and vacation policy, brand guidelines and more, all on a self-serve basis.

To level-up your wiki, click on the Optionsdrop down on the top right of the page and chooseTurn into Wiki.

##########################################

When you do this, youll keep your beautiful wiki layout, and also unlock valuable features like the ability to categorize and organize pages, add properties, verify documents, create different views and layouts, and more.
Discover the possibilities of Notion databases
Databases let you organize, categorize, filter, search and view information in many different ways.Explore the database section of theHelp Centerand visitNotion Academyto learn how to use databases.

##########################################

## Verify your documents so everyone will know theyre trustworthy
The wiki comes with 4 default properties: Owner (person property), Last edited date, Tags (multi-select) and a Verification property which is unique to wikis. You can add any additional properties to your team wiki that your team will find useful, such as Created date or Status.

##########################################

With the verification property, you can mark documents in the wiki with an expiration date. Once the verification expiry date arrives, youll receive a notification that its time to review the document. Then, you can make any changes or updates needed and renew the documents verification. Alternatively, you can mark a document as infinitely verified so that it will never expire - you can always adjust this later if necessary.
When your team members view a document and see the Verified property filled out, this will inspire trust. Only the page owner of a specific page in the wiki can verify it. When team members see the verification stamp, theyll know the content has been checked and wont need to ask around to make sure.

##########################################

Verification properties will be automatically added to your wiki. Team members can then choose the date that they want their document to be verified until, or select infinite.

##########################################

Here are some different ways the verification property comes in handy:
- Signal that documents are complete and up to dateWhen team members see the Verified property, theyll be able to trust that the document theyre looking at has been checked and marked as true and complete until further notice.
- Get reminded when its time to review or update wiki content Often, you dont realize a document is out of date until someone comes across it and questions it. The verification property helps you stay on top of information and you know youll be reminded when the time comes to update your information.
- Track and renew your team goals periodically You can create a page in your wiki for quarterly goals and verify that page until the end of the current quarter. When its time to review the document, youll analyze your progress and set new goals for the upcoming quarter.
- Create evergreen documents which wont change Documents like your company values and mission statement are likely to stay the same for a significant amount of time. You can mark these as infinitely verified so you never get notified to change them, though you can always change this status if necessary.

##########################################

The verification property is unique to wikis
A wiki has all the same properties as a regular database, plus an additional verification property.Learn more about database propertieshere.
## Filter and sort your wiki
When youre reviewing wiki content, you might want to see a particular sub-set of information - for example, everything related to onboarding, or training materials.
You can filter the information based on certain properties, sort information in unique ways, and create multiple views using different layouts.

##########################################

Here are some ways you might filter, sort and organize your wiki content:
- Review verified docs that are soon to expire Sort your wiki by verification expiry date so you can start going through docs that will soon be up for review.
- Check all non-verified docs in a simple list view Create a filtered view of all docs where the verification property is either expired, or left blank. You can then go through these docs and start filling up necessary information.

##########################################

- Update everything related to a particular topic If your company has just announced a change to the brand guidelines, for example, you can filter your wiki for everything tagged as related to branding. Then, go through and update all those docs with the changes.
- Check the relevancy of your oldest wiki content for updates You can sort your database by Created date (ascending) or Last edited date (ascending) and go through old or not frequently edited documents and see what needs to be refreshed.
Use permission settings to prevent unwanted edits

##########################################

You can adjust the permission settings of your wiki pages to ensure only certain people can make changes to content. Nominate team members who will be responsible for maintaining the wiki, and grant them full access. Everyone else can have View only access.Learn more about permissions and sharing settingshere.
## Go beyond your team wiki
There are many possible ways to use the wiki feature, and you can essentially turn any page with sub-pages into a database, allowing you to add properties to those pages.

##########################################

In addition to your team wiki, you could:
- Build a company-wide wiki Your organizations wiki can include information about benefits, vacations, org charts, company goals, etc.
- Create a customer help center wiki  You can create a public-facing help center where customers can find guides, tutorials, pricing pages and FAQs. This can reduce your support teams workload and help users get more from your product or service. Learn about publishing pages to the webhere.
- Design an engineering process wikiIn your engineering teams wiki, produce engineering-specific process documents like your triage process, design system, etc. The verification property will encourage your team to be more proactive about keeping all these process up-to-date.
- Turn your client portal into a wiki If you give clients access to a portal in Notion, you can make this into a wiki where its easier to filter and sort different information.

# Build a website with Notion in seconds, no coding required
Adding a page to your companys website is probably a lengthy process that requires balancing designers, engineers, and their busy schedules. Even the simplest pages are an effort in cross-functional work.

##########################################

But in Notion, all it takes to publish a page to the web is a single click. You can:
- Build beautiful pages without needing a developer dozens of embeds and tools like headers and columns allow you to make a visually rich website without all the developer resources you often need for more complicated content management systems.
- Publish pages yourself dont worry about wrangling designers or engineers to build or extend your site. You can quickly and easily make any Notion page public, accessible by a link you share, or even findable via search engines.

##########################################

## How to publish
With Notion, you can stand up a website with just a few clicks. All you have to do is clickShareon any page, navigate to thePublishtab, and click onPublish to Web. Anyone with the link will be able to see it. And when you make edits, your page will change for visitors in real time. It's that simple!
## Readymade templates & inspiration that extend your website
If you don't want to start from scratch, here are a few templates you can use as a springboard to get your pages up faster. Weve also included some inspiration from a few companies using Notion to build their websites.

##########################################

### Templates
Job Board with the fluidity of hiring, its helpful to have access to a job board youre able to quickly update, whether thats removing filled roles, adding new ones, or rewriting your company mission. Make your pages eye-catching and informative, providing a window into what its really like working for your company.
Copy thejob board templateinto your own workspace.
Help Center reduce your customer service email queue. Find the most commonly-asked questions by digging into your support inbox and publishing content covering those questions. This makes it easier for your customers to find the answers theyre looking for.
Notion makes it easy to organize this content as sub-pages, and edit it as needed.

##########################################

Help yourself to thehelp center template.
Blog post build a community and share dynamic content without relying on a rigid CMS. You can write blog posts in Notion and set them live, for a clean and easy reading experience. Embed elements like a table of contents, audio files, images and videos right into pages to create a more engaging experience.
Use theblog post templateto tell your story.
Roadmap share your product roadmap with potential leads and existing customers. A published roadmap gives customers insight into when a feature will ship and you can even allow them to submit feature requests by turning on public editing.

##########################################

## Bring Notion pages to life with these visual elements
Type/onto any page to reveal a whole menu of elements you can include on these pages. To access them, type/and the name of what you want to do, like/imageor/typeform.

##########################################

- Headers & line breaks make your content easier to scan and navigate withH1,H2, andH3headers. Separate long walls of text with line breaks by typing three dashes in a row.
- Columns give a page that clean newspaper-style layout with an image on one side and text on the other. Using theicon, you can drag-and-drop any pages, text, images, etc. anywhere on Notion pages. If you want to make columns, drag anything to the left or right of existing content. Blue vertical lines will appear to help guide you.
- Table of contents this gives readers the ability to jump to whichever section they need on your site. Type/tocto create a table of contents that uses your headers to break down sections.
- Image / video / audio create a multimedia experience. You can embed YouTube videos, upload podcast files, or drag images right into your Notion page. Using the bars on the sides of images or video, you can even adjust their size.
- Typeform embed gather feedback or create a contact portal by inserting a Typeform into your Notion page.
- Callouts & quotes bring attention to a specific section or sentence with callouts or quotes, much like youd find in many popular blogs.
- Toggles lists for content like FAQs, you can make your website even easier to navigate by helping site visitors see only the most relevant information to them. Put top-level info into a toggles preview, and nest more info inside it.
- Colors customize your design or emphasize content with different text or background colors. Highlight any text and select, then chooseColorto pick either the text or background color.

##########################################

## More public page options
Search engine indexing drive traffic and make your page visible on Google and other search engines.
Link expiration if you want to share your site only temporarily, use link expiration options. Great for sharing a custom portfolio with a client, or a sensitive doc with an external partner.

# Building a product requirement document in Notion
As a product manager, you're often working to pitch your product vision to many teams all at once. This requires intentional communication and carefully curated documents that fit the needs of the teams you're partnering with. A product requirement document (PRD) written in Notion can help to streamline and improve that communication.

##########################################

## What is a PRD?
A product requirement document outlines all of the steps you'll need to take to build a product  and it can vary a lot in structure from company to company, and even project to project. After initial ideation, a PRD will lay out all of the context for a project and can be used get multiple stakeholders on the same page. The overarching goal of a PRD is to tell the story of how your users will be using a product, without getting too far into the technical details. Often, product teams use PRDs to get alignment from multiple teams, and to serve as the single source of truth for a project.
Interested in user research?
Click to expand

##########################################

Ask 5 different people, and you'll get 5 different answers on what a PRD should include. Using Notion for your PRD means that you can contextualize the document to fit your use case. Need a lot of images? No problem. Need more wireframes? Easy. Typically, all PRDs will share the same 5 attributes.
- Context
- Goals or Requirements
- Constraints
- Assumptions
- Dependencies
## Best practices for PRDs in Notion
PRDs are typically a one page document that links out to any number of other sources, like design documents, images, user interviews, and more. Depending on how your team uses Notion, consider adding a PRD to a larger database of all projects, or creating a page in yourproduct home workspace.

##########################################

### Start with context
A good PRD will tell the reader everything they need to know about a project.

##########################################

You may choose to include summary text with context, a Loom walkthrough of a previous iteration of a product, or an audio recording of a user feedback call. Different projects require context delivered in different ways, and its important the reader has all the information so theyre not operating with blind spots down the line. Some tried and true strategies include:
- Add text and columns to add text, just start typing. To explore other block types use the / command. In addition, columns in Notion can be used to put information side by side. Using theicon, simply drag and drop information next to the relevant block. This is great for adding images with extra detail, or comparing new and old versions of a product.
- Embed everything, right in one place did you know you can add Figma, Sketch, GitHub, full webpages, andpretty much anything else, right inside Notion? This makes it easy to communicate your process and vision for a product in a customizable yet consolidated format. Your team can focus on the work at hand, instead of jumping between tools to find what they need.

##########################################

### Maintain consistent information with Synced Blocks
Synced blocks allow you to pull information from any place in Notion and keep all the documents up to date. In doing so, information stays consistent across pages. For example, you might have a mission statement you want at the top of your PRD. Turn that into a Synced Block, selectCopy and syncthen paste that block right into your PRD. That way, when the mission gets updated, it'll be updated everywhere automatically.
### Add a database for requirements
Use a database for task management if needed. While you may not need task management in the first iteration of your PRD, a database with responsibilities can be helpful as you grow and scale your project.

##########################################

- Assign tasks to individuals or groups with thePersonproperty.
- Add aDateproperty for due date and use a formula to calculate days until due.
- Add a priority column withSingle select.
Want to go further with task management?
Click to expand
Views will start to make your database feel super powerful. Rather than creating a Google calendar for your team, or a separate to-do tracker for each person, utilize views and filters to make sure everyone has exactly what they need to do their best work. The best part of this is that each view relies on the same underlying data and is therefore always up to date.

##########################################

- Board View best for task management, because cards are grouped by priority or assignee and easily dragged between stages.
- Table View birds eye view to manage all tasks and properties across functions and teams.
- List View view just the task list for a sleek and minimal vibe, or isolate properties to visually represent work.

### Comments and async collaboration in multiple points
Since a PRD will generally be shared with many folks working on or interested in a project, collaborative settings are important to keep everyone on the same page. For example:
- Request inputs using the @ key, tag stakeholders in comments so that you can get input right where you need it, and it will be visible to everyone else. Alternatively, you can add toggles at the bottom of a document where each person can add their own feedback.

##########################################

- Upvote ideas ask teammates to add "+1s" in comments to dial in on the most important parts of your project, and elaborate with their feedback.
- Control access adjust permission settings in the share menu on the top right such that only those who need it have comment or editing power.

# Use charts to visualize data and track progress directly in Notion
With Notions connected workspace, you can get your projects to the finish line faster and with less context switching. But without visualizations, managing large amounts of tasks can be cumbersome. Charts take your project management to the next level, helping you to monitor project progress, spot trends, and make decisions.

##########################################

With Notion charts you can:
- Visualize your project in realtime Forget about separate tools or tedious copy-pasting. When you add charts from Notion databases, theyll update automatically whenever a change is made to the underlying data or tasks.
- Make more informed decisions Looking at hundreds of tasks in a database can be overwhelming. Charts let you easily spot trends, monitor progress, and make decisions to move forward quicker than you might be able to otherwise.
- Break free from complicated analytics tools We all love our data partners, but wed prefer not to need them for absolutely everything. With charts, anyone can make beautiful visualizations in a few clicks using the UI they already know (and, hopefully, love!)

##########################################

In this guide, well cover how to make a chart, and discuss ways that you can use them to improve your project management in Notion.
## How your database becomes a chart
Charts work like any otherdatabase view meaning you can view the same data in multiple ways, and switch back and forth between them depending on your needs. To create a view, simply navigate to the+button in your database and select Chart. Within your chart view, you can filter your data, and customize your chart to craft a perfect picture of your projects progress.

##########################################

Notion charts come with 4 layout options, each serving a unique purpose:
- Donut charts for simple distribution Donut charts are a simple option for visualizing the distribution of tasks across different categories or team members, providing a clear view of resource allocation. For example, you might use one to analyze and balance the task load across your engineering team in a given sprint.
- Horizontal and vertical bar charts for multi-dimensional categorization Bar charts let you view database items with sub-groups, helping you quickly compare two categories, like status and task type. You might use a one of these to understand OKR progress by team and identify a bottleneck in your operating model.

##########################################

- Line charts for progress over time Line charts are best for tracking the progress of tasks over time, and can even be used to compare sub-groups. Like the number of pieces published each week in a given quarter, broken down by channel; or the number of tasks completed over time, by engineer.
As mentioned, youll also be able to sort and filter the data in your chart, add axis and data labels, and even customize your color palate. Learn more in the video below:
Now that youve got the basics, lets dive in to how charts help your work in the real world.

##########################################

### Combine charts to create a dashboard
Since charts are database views, you can create them anywhere in Notion by navigating to the page where you want the view to appear and typing/chart. Here youll be prompted to link an existing database. Do this multiple times, and youll be able to make a dashboard that lets you visualize data from multiple databases, or from the same database (in multiple ways!) in a single place.

##########################################

The beauty of Notions connected workspace means that unlike a chart created based on static data in a spreadsheet, these dashboards are living records of the work going on across your team, and they update in realtime. Use them for one database, or many. You might want to:
- Centralize scattered tracking systems if you have teams working across different project trackers (like your engineering tasks, and marketing campaign calendar), consider creating a dashboard to visualize the status of both projects simultaneously.
- Get an in-depth view of important work similarly, you might want to create a dashboard to view different cuts of the same database. Like an OKR dashboard that highlights different project statuses, key result progression, and tasks completed over time.
- Visualize team progress across projects as a team manager, you could create a dashboard to understand individual performance, irrespective of project statuses. Here, you might look at tasks assigned to each of your reports, overall projects each team member is on, and more.

##########################################

## 3 ways to use charts for your team
So how can you use charts (and dashboards!), to enhance your work? Lets consider three different kinds of projects that we commonly see managed inside of Notion.
### Create an OKR dashboard for your leadership team
Charts help visualizeOKRs, making it easier to track progress, enhance decision-making, and improve accountability. By analyzing trends and communicating goals clearly, teams can stay agile and keep leadership informed without creating an additional burden of reporting.

##########################################

You might consider creating a bar chart of OKR status by team to identify and mitigate potential risks. Similarly, a line chart of key result progress over time can help identify which teams have momentum, and those that might be slowing down.
### Visualize whats coming with your product roadmap
Charts offer a strategic view of yourproduct roadmap, enabling your team to allocate resources efficiently and prioritize features with precision. By visualizing upcoming features and their timelines, you can ensure that your team stays on track and meets key milestones, ultimately leading to a more streamlined and effective development process.

##########################################

### Deepen understanding of your content library
If you manage yourcontent calendarin Notion, you can use charts to understand both in progress and published content at a glance.
You might use a line chart track content scheduling and publishing to maintain a consistent release schedule. This helps identify delays or inconsistencies in your workflow.
At the same time, you can visualize content distribution by tagging pieces based on channel in a bar chart. This ensures that each audience segment receives the appropriate amount of content and could help you refactor plans to make sure all of your audiences needs are met.

##########################################

## Enhance your existing project management suite with charts
While this guide covered the bulk of what you need to know to get started, the possibilities for using charts are pretty endless, especially when combined with other project management features in Notion. Here are a few more advanced ways to use charts in your workspace:
- Turn synced databases into a chart Synced databasespull information from tools like Jira, Asana, and GitHub into your Notion workspace to let you visualize 3rd party tasks as a Notion database. Consider turning these synced databases into charts so that your project manager can get a view of whats happening across all of these different tools in one glance.

##########################################

- Visualize AI-generated content tags WithAI autofill, you can generate tags for every row in your database based on page content in seconds. Why not use charts to visualize those tags? This makes for quick exploration of large data sets with very little work to audit and tag your data in the first place.
- Embed charts from different data sources in your dashboard You canembedcharts from external data sources such as Tableau, Mixpanel, or Google Analytics into Notion. Add these alongside the charts youre using for project tracking to create a comprehensive view of your teams performance, without leaving the Notion app.

# Connect your tools to Notion with the API
We believe that if every business and person can tailor software to their problems, the world will be better at solving its problems. Notions mission is to make this a ubiquitous reality.
With the launch of our API, youll be able to customize Notion even further  teams and developers can build powerful integrations that connect Notion to the tools and workflows they use every day. This opens up a whole new set of problem-solving capabilities for Notion users.
The API unlocks an initial set of capabilities, setting the foundation for future additions. Teams at Zapier, Typeform, and Automate.io are building integrations you can use to bring information from disparate apps together in Notion.

##########################################

To start building with the API, visitdevelopers.notion.com
## API basics
The API allows developers to connect other software to Notion or automate workflows within Notion through integrations.
For example, sales teams might connect Salesforce to Notion  every time a deal is closed in Salesforce, its automatically added to a Notion database so you can manage these accounts cross-functionally on Notion (with teams who arent using Salesforce). Or your engineering team might build an integration that connects Jira to Notion, so bug tickets can be pulled into a database where all teams can see what's being worked on.

##########################################

These integrations take siloed information from different tools and centralizes them in Notion for better, more effective work between teams.
And to make the API as accessible as possible, it is available to all Notion users.
### Whats the API do?
The API allows for programmatic interaction with databases, pages, and content within Notion. This is done through a series of endpoints  places where the API is communicating and working with Notion to collect and organize information from other sources (like apps). Your team can build or use pre-built integrations to automate workflows for more efficient work.

##########################################

Heres a high-level overview of what the API can do:
- For databasesdatabasesare core to how information is stored in Notion. With the API, you can pull specific database entries, search a list of specific database entries based on properties, and get a list of all entries in a database.
- For pages & blocksblockscomprise Notion pages, allowing you to customize pages depending on your needs, whether in a team wiki or part of a database. The API enables you to create new pages (in a database or in another page), set page properties, or retrieve page properties based on specific requests. You can even create new blocks in those pages and pull all the blocks from a page.

##########################################

- For people in your workspace for teams of all sizes, seeing admins, members, and guests in your workspace helps foster transparency. With Notions API, you can get a list of all workspace users. We recommend taking advantage ofSCIMto programmatically create and remove members from your workspace.
Visit ourdeveloper hubfor a deep dive on how to build and use specific integrations.
## Notions API in action
Want to see what can be built with Notions API? Our partners are already building custom integrations and workflows that bring information from many apps together in Notion.

##########################################

### Zapiers integration
Zapier automatically moves information between Notion and other applications you use every day. It already supports thousands of other apps, such as Slack, Jira, Salesforce, and more.
Using Zapier, you can create automated workflows that cement Notion as your teams information hub. For example, you can centralize new sales deals, advertising metrics, or website analytics in Notion with no need for your team to manually copy the information over.
Get startedhere.
### Typeforms form response integration
Typeform helps anyone build online forms and surveys. Its native integration collects all of your form responses in Notion in real-time, so that you easily share them with your team and turn them into powerful insights.

# A connected workspace for product teams to collaborate, ideate and launch
As a product manager, you sit at the intersection of engineering, design, and marketing. Each team has its own tools and processes, which sometimes results in a lack of visibility into what anyone else is working on.
In Notion, work and documentation are intertwined. You can collaborate across teams with clarity about what everyone is working on. Instead of jumping back and forth between tools, you can manage every aspect of your work - from projects, tasks, and documents to note-taking, wikis and roadmaps. You can even embed work happening into other tools directly into your Notion pages.

##########################################

In this guide, well show you how to create a home for all your product teams work in Notion.
## One home for all your teams work
Building a Notion workspace means you can reduce the number of specialist tools you need - and please your finance team by reducing your subscriptions for the tools you do keep. This is because, with Notion, work that happens in other tools need not stay hidden there.
Inside a project page, for example, you can embed files, images, videos, and even sync content from GitHub, Jira, Figma and more, bringing work from those tools into your project where everyone can see the latest version.

##########################################

This simplifies your workflow, and instead of context-switching throughout the day, you can create a more productive environment that helps everyone stay in their flow state.
Its much easier for team members to find the information they need to make progress. Everything is organized logically in one tool, and people know where to look.
So, lets take a look at some ideal Notion use cases for your product team.
## Bring your knowledge to life with a team wiki
Your product teams knowledge base is where all team members will go to find information relevant to their work and role.
SOPs, guidelines, quarterly goals, training resources, onboarding materials, your team directory, and more can live here.

##########################################

You can create your team homepage by creating top-level pages and sub-pages and arranging it all in a wiki layout. Then, go to the options menu and clickTurn to Wiki. This adds another layer of features to your wiki - you can assign properties to pages, view information in different layouts (table, list, etc.), and also enablesPage Verificationwhich lets team members know the information contained in a page is current.
Discover how to build a team or company wikihere.
Verify your wiki documents

##########################################

When you turn your knowledge into a wiki, all pages will have a verification property. Page owners can verify a document for 30 days, 90 days or indefinitely. This helps you keep wiki content up to date - when verification expires, youll receive a notification.Learn more about wikis and page verificationhere.
## Create customizable, dynamic product documents
Solid documentation helps keep everyone up to speed and standardizes your work and processes.
With a docs database in Notion, you can

##########################################

- Standardize docs and boost efficiency with templates You can create database templates for familiar docs like PRDs, RFCs, Project Kickoffs and more. This means you can recreate documents quickly, and keeps your documentation standardized and complete.
- Categorize documents in helpful ways You can use a select or multi-select to tag docs according to their type. then you can always filter the database to show certain kinds of docs so you can always find what you need.
- Collaborate seamlessly in a document If youre working on a RFC or similar collaborative document, you can invite team members to leave comments on specific blocks throughout the page, or start a discussion in the comments section at the top.

##########################################

- Make documents engaging with different elements on one page Notion pages are fully customizable. Organize blocks of text into columns, headers, and bullets, embed videos, images, or links, and even sync content from other tools.
- Draft documents in a flash with Notion AI In just a few minutes, you can draft and edit a product document that might have previously taken hours. Hit the spacebar to call up Notion AI in any page.

##########################################

## Keep track of your teams work with Projects & Tasks databases
Many project management tools just link out to your work. But, in Notion, work and task management live side by side.
You can use ourProjects & taskstemplate to create two project management databases that are ready to use.
Not only can you assign daily tasks and oversee their completion - you can connect these tasks to larger initiatives in your projects database.

##########################################

Here are some tips for task and project management in Notion:
- See how daily tasks relate to projects You can use arelation propertyto create a 2-way link between your tasks and your projects. This means you can connect tasks to the project they relate to, so youll always know what steps are required to complete your projects.

##########################################

- Split large tasks into small manageable steps  Breaking daunting tasks down into individual steps is project management 101. This will make your projects more manageable and clear, and let you assign tasks to different team members. Split projects into tasks, and then, usesub-tasks and dependenciesto divide tasks into smaller action steps and see how they connect to one another.
- View tasks and projects in different ways depending on context Notion databases can be arranged in many different layouts like board view, table, list, timeline and calendar. In the same database block, you can have a table view showing all your projects, a board view organized by project status, and a timeline view showing how different commitments intersect. Learn about database viewshere.

##########################################

- See sub-sets of information useful in certain contextsFilter and sortyour databases to show sub-sets of information, such as all projects where certain team members are involved or all tasks due in the next week.
- View your database in different places Createlinked databasesanywhere in the workspace to resurface your information in another place. For example, you can create a linked version of the tasks database in your own private page, then filter this linked database to show all tasks that are assigned to you.
## Roadmaps that everyone can follow
Roadmaps help your product team track sprints, epics, and fix bugs - in other words, get all the pieces into place for your next big launch.

##########################################

Theyre a vital tool for cross-functional collaboration, where you set priorities and get everyone on the same trajectory.

##########################################

Get started with ourRoadmap template- here are some things you can do:
- Link your roadmap to tasks and projects Build stronger connections between daily work and larger initiatives.
- Get everyone aligned with launch dates  A roadmap gives everyone a chance to see whats up next on the launch calendar and set their priorities.
- Use a timeline to scope out work Create atimeline viewof your roadmap, so you can easily see how all your commitments overlap.
- Report bugs with abutton Reporting bugs to the engineering team need not be a lengthy process. Create a button (on your product teams homepage, for example) where your team members can instantly Report a Bug. Clicking the button will create a new database entry that they can customize and save.

##########################################

- Plan your weekly sprints and scrumsConsult your roadmap to review the weeks priorities before you plan your weekly sprints and scrums. You can even add a linked version of the Roadmap into the template for those meetings so its always easy to access.
## A strong note-taking system where meetings lead to action
When teams collaborate, relying on emails and messages for communication isnt enough. Sometimes, you have to bring everyone into a meeting to get aligned and agree on next steps.
For meetings to be productive, you need a shared space to outline agendas, take notes, and create action items that wont get forgotten.

##########################################

With ourmeeting notes template, you can create a database to help you have more productive meetings that move you closer to your objectives.
Using the meeting notes database, you can:
- Automatically create entries for recurring meetings Create a meeting template for a regular meeting - like sprint kickoff or your daily standup - with a space for your agenda, notes, and actions. Then, turn that into arepeating templatethat will recreate weekly, once every two weeks, or once a month, for example.

##########################################

- Link meetings to their relevant projects With a relation property, link your meeting notes with projects. Then you can tag meetings with the relevant project, which helps make all context about a project easy to access.
- Revisit past meetings to see what was discussed and agreedupon Instead of forgetting what was talked about after the meeting is over, your team members can go back and review past meetings and their outcomes.
- Catch up with anything youve missed  Use a person property to tag everyone who attends a meeting. If one of your team members has been away, they can filter the database to show meetings where they arent tagged and quickly get up to speed with what they missed.
- Add tasks and action items straight to your database Instead of just writing down action items, send them straight to the tasks database with one click.Create a buttonin the meeting note template to add new items to your task database. You can add any new tasks immediately and even fill out some properties on the go.

## Build a smart, dynamic workspace for everyone
Notion lets you create a workspace where your product team can work, find useful resources, collaborate, and share information with other teams.

##########################################

You can design this workspace according to how your team works best - here are some ways to build smart connections throughout your workspace:
- Use buttons to automate and simplify processes You can create buttons anywhere in the workspace which allow you to automatically generate blocks in the page, or add and edit database items. Buttons can help speed up and simplify complex workflows - learn how to use buttonshere.
- View the same content in multiple placesBy creatinglinked databases, you can resurface database content (or a filtered subset of the content) anywhere. You can alsosync blocks blocks of text, tables, and more. When you duplicate them, you can edit all the instances at once.
- Bring all relevant content into your OKRs pageWhen youre working towards a goal, you can bring all relevant content into yourOKRs page, from related projects and tasks to meetings and documents. Its easier to see your progress and keep everyone on track.
- Plug content from other tools into Notion You can bridge the gap between product, engineering, design teams, and more using integrations. You canembed contentfrom a wide variety of tools directly into your Notion pages and even createsynced databasesfrom tools like Jira and Github to give your team total clarity.
- Collaborate effortlessly using mentionsUse the @ tag tomention pages, people, or datesanywhere on the page to instantly connect with someone. You can also comment and tag people on pages and specific blocks.

# Create a hybrid work hub

As the world and workplace adapt to guidance surrounding COVID-19, many workplaces are navigating conversations around hybrid working environments where some employees work remotely, while others work in an office space. One of the most important things for the success of a hybrid model is clear communication and expectation setting across all employees.
## Consolidate important documents into a wiki
When information is organized and accessible for your team, you empower them to do their best work, wherever they are, and wherever they want to be. Processes, philosophies, and guidelines live in one place and can be easily updated, which is especially important in a landscape where the ground is shifting constantly.

##########################################

Give your teams one easy place to access all of this information with a rockstar wiki. This acts as the single-source of truth for teams navigating a new way of work.
- Guidelines and philosophies bring together the many, many emails and updates about working environment into one single-source of truth. Clearly outline expectations for office workers and remote workers, and those who do a little bit of both  like when to change your Slack status, for example. Where you can,communicate philosophiesbehind decisions so that employees can understand the company vision.

##########################################

- Health and safety measures this will be top of mind for many employees. Your company likely already has documentation around the important work you're doing to keep folks safe, so make sure it is linked here for all to read. (If you're not familiar withbacklinks, this would be a great place to use them). You can even includePDFs or embedded web pageshere to share external resources, like local, state, or global guidelines.
- Zoom backgrounds don't forget your remote friends when designing a hybrid work hub. Foster unity and culture by distributing "official" company zoom backgrounds for all types of occasions.

## Create workflows for managing logistics with databases
Hybrid work requires an intentional operational shift not only from the days before the pandemic, but also from the "normal" of the past year and a half. Often, it takes some upfront work to build these systems but once you do, the payoff is immense for your teammates working anywhere in the world.
Notion databases are the way to go here. Not only do they organize work, they also act as a place to do the work  each cell opens up into its own page. Teammates can see whats happening at a high level, and dig deeper inside pages if they want more info. This helps sow transparency between individuals and teams.

##########################################

- Reserve desks, conference rooms, and other equipment between health and safety measures and team growth, many groups are working in capacity-constrained spaces. Ensure everyone has the equipment they need for work by creating a sign-up system for desks and conference rooms. Try using alinked databaseandformulasfor extra texture to keep track of special requests like ultra-wide monitors, accessible seating options, or after-hours access.

##########################################

- Collect lunch orders create a single calendar for office events and lunches so people can order ahead of time. This also helps create consistency in process so no one ends up left out because they missed that one important Slack message.
- Detail daily procedures a list is a nice way to package need-to-know information like what to do if you're the first one to arrive at the office, or the last one to leave. You can include information on greeting visitors, requesting snacks, and more. Because it's a database under the hood, you can add properties likeresponsible team member,updated time,location, and more to better organize information.
- Link to your company directory if you have multiple offices, consider adding avisitingproperty to your people directory, and adding a filtered view in your environment hub so that resident employees can stay connected.

##########################################

All things databases!

## Bring your document to life
Your digital working environment should be as dynamic as your physical one. Invite employees into the conversation with embedded elements and automations.

##########################################

- Request feedback in an embedded Typeform youre doing your best to make the environment work for everyone. Try including an anonymous feedback form inline so that you can better understand employee engagement.  Simply use the/typeformcommand to get started.
- Connect to a Slack channel things change! That's ok. Keep the company up to date by setting up automatic Slack notifications for updates to key documents. Remember that health & safety guidelines page? Don't leave employees to wonder how your company is responding to changing regulations - set up an@channelthat triggers when updates are made to your page.
- Create a poll for an upcoming event ask questions at all hands with a "Q&A" database. Not only does this help remote workers stay connected, it promotes equity across all environments ensuring that every voice is heard. Using databases, add a people property for "upvoted by" add a second property with this formula to tally the number of votes(if(empty(prop(" Upvoted By")), toNumber(""), length(prop(" Upvoted By")) - length(replaceAll(prop(" Upvoted By"), ",", "")) + 1).

## Have fun and celebrate team culture
Building culture remotely is a key piece of managing a hybrid team, especially for newly onboarded teammates. Create spaces for fun and connection.

##########################################

- Schedule virtual events use a calendar (and create a list view) to advertise virtual events like happy hours and workshops. Consider usingZapierorautomate.ioto integrate google calendar with Notion and store extra details about the event in a linked location.
- Show off office tunes if your team contains music connoisseurs, consider sharing your favorite playlists inside Notion. Play them at team meet-ups, or before your next all-hands!
- Create a reading/watching list use theNotion Web Clipperto add insightful articles to a shared database. Or, do the same thing with your favorite binge-worthy TV shows that are captivating lunch table conversation. This makes it easier for employees in all locations to form genuine, human connections.

##########################################

There's no one-size-fits-all approach to working environment, and there's no one-size-fits-all tool to manage it. Use the strategies above and customize your Notion space to work for you!

# Creating and organizing your reading list using Notion: A step-by-step guide
- Notion can help you neatly keep track of the content you want to read, listen to, or watch.
- You can build your reading list from scratch, or select an pre-built template from our template gallery.A Notion reading list is a dynamic table with properties such as dates, select menus, text, and links to classify each entry.Apply filters to your database to make better sense of your entries. For instance, you could decide to only view the things you havent read yet.

# Creating links & backlinks
- As your Notion workspace grows, links and backlinks make it easy to connect related pages.
- To create a link, hit the opening bracket key twice, start typing the name of the page you want to link to, and select the page when it shows up. This will automatically create a backlink at the top of your page.When you click on any of these backlinks, youll be automatically taken to the part of the text where the page was mentioned.Backlinks help you discover related pages about specific topics. They're like your very own references" section, one that is created automatically.

- Links in Notion are dynamic and update themselves. If you change a page's title or icon, every link to that page will automatically update.

# Database properties help organize your teams information
Properties are the backbone of databases. They help you organize the pages in your database based on criteria you decide.
Want to make sure projects all get a deadline? There's a property for that. Want to assign a project manager? Property for that too. What about tagging the type of project? Yep, properties do that.
With properties, you can get a snapshot view of information associated with each page in a database  and maybe even more importantly, filter data based on different property types.

##########################################

There are a couple of ways to add a property: within a database page or by selectingPropertieson the top right of your database. Click+ Add a propertyin either scenario, name the property, and select the type you want. Let's get into how to use them.
Better databases have arrived!
While the concepts outlined in this guide are still useful, references to specific product actions may be a bit outdated! Databases were redesigned in March 2022, so your experience may differ slightly from whats pictured and described here.This guideoutlines the new database features, including what's changed.

##########################################

## Basic properties for every database
While databases can house everything from engineering sprints to content calendars, there are key properties that are table stakes for most Notion databases. These help tell you whats happening, whos responsible, and when its due (or just about anything else you need to know about a database page).

##########################################

Here are some of the basic properties you can use to organize almost every database:
- Name in a table database, the first column shows "Name" at the top. This is where you'll name the pages that go in your database. Each page also contains all the pages properties and lets you store information like drafts, images, code, and more.
- Select customize how you tag projects in a database, like by priority, project type, teams, or status. Maybe HR has anapplicant tracking database. Use aSelectproperty to assign stages, like "Onsite Interview or "Offer. You can quickly create new tags by clicking on the cell for the property. And any tags you've created will show up as a dropdown list to choose from.
- Multi-select this is just like aSelectproperty, but you can assign multiple attributes to a page. Going back to the applicant tracking example, you can add aMulti-selectproperty called Skills for all the proficiencies you gathered from a candidates resume and interviews.

##########################################

- Person tag teammates with this property, whether they're the project owner or participating in some regard. This ensures everyone knows who's responsible for what.
- Date set deadlines or establish a start and end date for completing your project. Yourengineering teammight use date properties for feature launches, but also for the two-week sprints to build these features. You can set each of these separately, thencreate a timeline vieworganized by ship dates and execution dates.
Wed be remiss not toboards whichgroup pagesinto columns based onSelect,Multi-selectorPersonproperties.

##########################################

For example, you might group a board by project manager (aPersonproperty) to see what everyone has on their plates. You might also want to group pages by their status (aSelectproperty) like "Not started or "In progress. Makingmultiple database viewswith this information also helps you get a quick download of projects based on what you need.
Together, these properties give your team a simple way to organize large sets of information.
Create views to surface relevant database information

## Need to store different types of information? Use these properties
Add a little more texture to your properties by using them to hold all the materials you might need as part of the work at hand.

##########################################

- Files & media upload relevant files right into this property. For example, you can add the hero images for any blog posts or social media content and display it ingallery view. Using a property for this information also makes it easy to download, instead of needed to find it in the body of the pages.
- Text use a text property to summarize a page's content or provide high-level details. That way, you can quickly grab the essential information right from the database instead of dipping into the page itself. Your sales team might use this property to give a couple lines about your competitors in an audit to reference during sales calls.

##########################################

- Checkbox ensure project owners complete specific items. If you develop SEO-polished content, add checkboxes to ensure writers hit the target keywords, use internal links, and other on-page optimizations. Thenadd a filterwhere unchecked items dont show in your database. That way, you see in seconds what content still needs work.
- URL, Email, Phone quickly follow up with prospects by including every leads contact information into your CRM databases (and here's aCRM templateyou can use!).
## Advanced properties for better project management
Maybe you want to connect two databases, or see when a page in a database was last edited. These advanced properties help your team get the most out of databases.

##########################################

- Relations connect two databases together withrelationsto get the full picture of your work. For example, your product team might be launching a new feature, with all the information housed in a page in your roadmap database. You can use a relation to connect your roadmap to a database of your teams meeting notes, meaning all relevant meetings about that project are accessible right on the projects page.

##########################################

- Rollups this helps your aggregate data based on relations. Let's say you have a database of tasks that need to be completed prior to releasing a new feature, with each task having a checkbox. You can rollup these tasks to see the progress being made toward launch. Learn more aboutrollups.
- Created time as soon as a page is created, this will timestamp it with the date and time. This helps when you're cleaning up a database to remove outdated project specs or research guidelines.
- Created by see who created pages, which helps when you're organizing pages based on their creators. For example, you can use this property to filter meeting notes based on the ones you drafted.

##########################################

- Last edited time & by auto-populate the timestamp that a page was last edited (and by who). When youre project managing a page where many people are collaborating, this can be especially helpful.
- Formula show progress on a project, get votes on questions for your next all-hands meeting, calculate taxes, and more byinserting formulas into your database. They allow your team to run calculations and functions based on other properties.
## Display only the properties you need to see
Like your favorite jacket, you may not need certain database properties around all the time, but you want them handy.

##########################################

Toggle on/off properties depending on what you want to see by hittingPropertiesat the top of your database. You can also use these in different views  like in your project roadmap you might only want to see the DRI and launch date properties, or in your calendar view, you may only need to see the project type.
To further customize your properties, you can choose which ones arehidden or visible. Inside your databases project pages, hit theto the left of the property and chooseHide property. Here, you can select whether the property is always visible, always hidden, or only visible when its in use.

# Databases reimagined whats changed?
Inaccessible information isnt usable. Tasks, notes, personal goals, work goals  this information needs to be easy to find, referenced in multiple places, and visualized whatever way helps you be more productive. Notion databases make this possible, but theres always room for improvement. So we reimagined databases from the ground up, and now theyre more powerful than ever.
## Heres whats new
If youre like us, you use databases for just about everything  managing meeting notes, projects, documentation and more. In this guide well break down whats new with databases, and how you can make the most of them  on your own, or with a team.

##########################################

Heres whats new with databases:
- Quick filters  make it easy to limit the items you see in a database view, and any changes you make to filters and sorts of shared database views wont affect other people on the team until you clickSave for everyone.
- Select a data source now when you create a new database or view, youll see an option to select a data source, making it easy to include synced content from other databases in your workspace.
- Streamlined design find all your customization options like filters, sorts, groupings, and more, in oneView optionsmenu. Plus, quickly access your views by switching between tabs at the top of your database. Fewer clicks between you and displaying information in whatever way makes sense to your brain.

## Heres what that means for you
### Consolidate your companys single source of truth
Notion experts have known about the power of linked databases for years, and we want to make it more accessible to all.
Every time you create a new database or view, youll be given the option to select an existing data source from the workspace. We recommend using just a few core database for day-to-day operations of your work and life, rather than a whole bunch of smaller databases. For teams, meeting notes, tasks, and docs tend to be a good place to start. Then, when you want to reference or add that information somewhere else in your workspace you simply make a new view of the existing database.

##########################################

If youre used to exclusively creating databases from scratch you might be wondering what circumstances are best to take advantage of existing data sources. Heres a few guiding principles. Generally speaking, you should sync an existing data source when:
- You want to consolidate disparate information we often see people create new databases for their team, even when the framework already exists elsewhere in their workspace. Instead of trying to remember if last weeks project launch meeting notes live in the marketing database, or in engineering database, you can simply make use of one, company-wide database called meeting notes and createviewsin each team pages hub. This way you have clarity and synergy at all levels  up, down, and across your org chart.
- You want to use the same properties from another database if you want to organize a list of meetings, with participants, date, and more, theres no use in setting up six identical meeting notes databases with slightly different names. Thats what tags and filters are for. Instead, have one source of notes and utilize tags and views to denote specific team or project-based meetings. This helps keep you organized, and with a bigger group, can make it abundantly clear when theres an unnecessary redundancy in work.
- An existing view living elsewhere in your workspace would be helpful views are now re-usable when you create a new linked instance. No more manually recreating the filters, sorts and other customization in every new linked instance! If youre ever finding yourself wanting to recreate a view structure, its probably best just to pull that original data source in and add a few properties for your new project.

##########################################

What about linked databases?
Click to expand
### Leverage your data better with views and tabs
For the first time, you can use views of different data sources inside one block. This means that you can display endless amounts of information without taking up more space on your page, and it makes it easier for collaborators to connect the dots between otherwise loosely connected pieces of information. In addition, you can now display these views as tabs, so its easier to find what youre looking for.

##########################################

- Connect multiple data sources into one place lets say you have one database of companies that your sales team is in contact with and another of contacts at those companies. Previously, you would have had to display each database separately, maybe inline on a page. Now you can pull all of those bits of information together into one place  easier access to the information that matters!
- Copy views from the source we all have our go-to database views, curated perfectly to our needs. When you select a data source from elsewhere in your Notion workspace, youll have the option to chose a view from the original location and all of view options will be automatically applied.
- Tabs make it easier to find information oftentimes, you dont know what youre missing until you see it. Rather than hiding displays with differing layouts, sorts and filters inside of a dropdown menu, you can now make use of tabs to draw attention to your most important views.

##########################################

Go further to link information together
Click to expand
### Get your thoughts out faster with a unified View options menu
All your favorite database customization options  filters, sorts, grouping & more  are now consolidated in a unifiedView optionsmenu. As weve added features to our databases, we realized a need for a totally revamped menu, so thats what we created. In it, youll find the options youre used to seeing across the top of your database layout,properties,filter, andsort.

##########################################

- Layouts help you see data in new ways Notion lets you visualize your data as a table, calendar, timeline, list, board, or gallery.
- Properties let you add detail within a view like a table you might want to see all of your properties listed in one place. Sometimes though, its helpful to isolate just a few bits of key information. The properties option lets you toggle properties on and off so that you can focus on what matters. You might want to know information about priority on your per person board view, but could toggle it off on your launch calendar.

##########################################

- Filters let you isolate information based on properties as you lean into using a few centralized databases to manage your day to day, filters will become extremely useful. You can isolate information by any kind of property including tag or person. That way you only see the information you need at that moment. Like for example, just blog posts where the status is published.
- Sort and group for even more tailored management sometimes you dont want to flip through several views to see information. In these cases, consider grouping your content, like by publication status or author, to get a three dimensional birds eye view of what everyone is working on.

##########################################

### Quick filter to find information you need
Finally, filters are easier and faster to create  they require less clicks and feel more modern. Instead of creating a new view for yourself to find that one small piece of information, you can add a quick filter that is viewable only by you until you hit Save for everyone.
This change also means that Filter groups, often too clunky for day to day use, are no longer the default. These filter groups still exist under the advanced filter option for when you need them, but theyre out of sight (and mind) when you dont.

##########################################

We often say that databases are like intelligent filing cabinets. Unlike filing cabinets that sit in your home collecting dust, your Notion databases are continuously improving. We hope these database improvements make it easier for you to manage all of the bits and pieces of information in your work, and life.

## Different ways to customize the docs database
You can start using the template out of the box and customize it with properties, views, filters and more.
Here are some suggestions for upgrading your docs database.
### Create templates for RFCs, PRDs and more
With database templates you can quickly create new database entries with certain properties and key information already filled out on the page.
An RFC (Request for Comment) is a type of feature spec document where you summarize the what, why and how of a feature youre proposing to build, and invite your team to comment and give feedback.

##########################################

To create an RFC template in your database, go to the dropdown next toNewand click+ New template. Once youve edited the page, youll be able to create a new RFC by going to the dropdown and selecting your template.
Database templates
Templates let you generate new database pages based on a predesigned format, so all you have to do is fill in the blanks. Learn more about creating and editing database templateshere.
Your RFC template might contain different sections to summarize the feature summary, and describe the reasoning behind the proposal, your method, the pros and cons, potential impact and any unresolved questions.

##########################################

Show_RFCAnother useful template for your docs database is a PRD (Product Requirement Document). A PRD helps you plan, design and develop new products and features in collaboration with your team, and youll find one ready to use in the databases template menu.
In your PRD template, you can add sections where youll outline:
- The problem you want to solve, and why Explain what problem you are solving, for who, and why it matters for your users.
- How you propose to solve the problem What action will you take to solve the problem, and why did you land on that solution?
- Your action steps or plan for solving the problem What are you going to build, and how will you measure the success of the new feature? You can outline each step required.

##########################################

You could add more sections to define the project goals and KPIs, note any limitations, assumptions, dependencies that exist, etc. You could even include a linked copy of your tasks database showing tasks related to this project.
Take a look at thisPRD templatefor more inspiration.
You can create any templates you want for your product team, for all kinds of document your team uses on a regular basis.
### Add some additional properties
You can add as many properties as you need to your docs database.

##########################################

The following properties might be useful:
- Tag docs with a specific doc typeUse the suggested propertyDoc typeto categorize your document as a Product Spec, RFC, etc.
- Relate documents to your projects, tasks or meeting notes Add a relation to other databases to link your documentation to task management and conversations with your team.
- Use a rollup to show how many incomplete tasks are left to do Once youve related your docs to your tasks database, you can use a rollup property to show how many incomplete tasks relate to a particular document.
- Give documents a status like To Do, In Progress or Complete Use the Status property to indicate what stage the document is at. You can also add secondary status tags like Waiting, Blocked etc.

##########################################

Learn more about database propertieshere.
### Experiment with different layouts, filters and sorting
Databases can come in many forms, and you can create multiple views for different contexts. To create a new view in your database, click the+button next to your existing views. This will bring up a menu where you can name your view and choose the type of layout you want.

##########################################

In addition to the views already existing in the template, you could create:
- A view showing all docs that need to be reviewed Create a new view and call it To Review. Then, click onFilterbyStatusand select In Review.
- A board database grouped by status Add a board database view, and underGroup byselectStatus. Now, youll see all your documents to do in a helpful kanban layout.
- A list database showing each type of document When you start to have a lot of items in the database, you can create separate saved views filtered to show each type of document. So, if you wanted to look through all your RFCs, you can open up that view.
- A calendar view organizing docs by their due date You can add another date property to give documents a due date. Create a calendar view, then underShow calendar byselect the due date property.

Notion AI only shows you information from places you can access. And don't worry  Notion keeps your data safe and sound. We never use it for AI training.

##########################################

## Limit your search to trusted knowledge sources
Sometimes you know exactly where to find information, but need a hand parsing through it quickly. You can ask Notion AI to look in specific sources for more precise answers. This means you can zero in on one particular area instead of sifting through everything connected to Notion.
Let's say you're a customer service agent helping a customer who's facing account login issues. All your team's CX macros live inside your team's Customer Support knowledge hub, but you're pressed for time and can't spot the procedure to troubleshoot the problem.

##########################################

Here's how you can quickly ask Notion AI to do the heavy lifting for you:
- Look for theAll sourcesoption at the bottom of your Notion AI chat box.
- Click onAll sourcesto unfurl a dropdown menu.
- ChooseCX Knowledge Basefrom the dropdown to narrow your search to your Customer Service knowledge hub.
- Now, ask your specific question. For example: "What are the steps to troubleshoot common login issues?" Notion AI will then search only within your knowledge hub for the relevant steps. You can even take it a step further and ask Notion AI to draft an email response you can send straight to your customer.
Pro tip: Use "@" mentions to get even more specific

##########################################

Want to drill down to a specific page within your knowledge hub? Simply mention it in your question. For example, ask Notion AI "Check the '@Customer Access Issues Manual' for the steps to help this customer with login troubles?"

## Leverage a more powerful writing Notion AI
Notion AI now comes with more powerful writing capabilities. It can tap into your workspace and the wider world to help you create high-quality content, brainstorm ideas, draft documents, and even reformat pages based on templates. Think of it as your on-demand copy reviewer and editor that not only captures your ideas but also helps organize and refine them into a clear, structured format.

##########################################

Pro tip: Refine as you go
Don't worry about getting it perfect on the first try. You can always ask Notion AI to make tweaks or additions to your new page after it's created. It's all about iterating until you've got exactly what you need.
Here are some ways you can use this powerful writing tool:
- Make your content follow a specific style guide Let's say you're working on a press release and you want it to align with your content team's style guide. Simply ask Notion AI to "revise this content to match the style guide @[style guide page].". Notion AI will then fine-tune your text, ensuring it aligns with the content team's established guidelines.
Try this flow

##########################################

- Find a well-written piece of content within your Notion workspace. Let's say it's an exemplary project document (we'll call it "Project Lumi").
- Ask Notion AI to match the content of your draft to the tone and voice of @ "Project Lumi".


- Make better outlines for your content- Let's say you're writing a history report, but your notes are all over the place in Google Slides and Google Docs. Ask Notion AI for help. Choose Google Drive as your search source, then ask Notion AI to make a report outline for you based on all the information it finds on your desired topic. It will quickly look at your documents and create a well-organized outline, saving you time and work.
Try this flow

# Get answers about work content faster with Q&A
Your companys Notion workspace stores all the information that teams and individuals rely on  product roadmaps, PTO policies, onboarding docs, and more.
Answers to important questions live inside these pages, but team members often spend longer than they should hunting for vital information.
Q&A surfaces answers immediately, so you can leverage all the information in your Notion workspace.
For employees at Remote (a global HR platform of over 1,000+ distributed teammates), it used to take 5-10 minutes to find an answer to every question, multiple times a day. Theyre now using Q&A across their entire workspace to get answers in seconds.

##########################################

Instead of digging for information and context-switching throughout the day, you can stay focused.
In this guide, well show how Q&A helps everyone work faster and move forward with work independently.
## Q&A gives you the answers you need in seconds
Regardless of your role, function, or company size, you probably spend a fair amount of time searching for the information you need to do your work.
Even with a comprehensive knowledge base in Notion, team members dont always know how or where to find what they need. Often, information lives in a separate place from where theyre working, or doesnt exist in a form they can make sense of. So they ping a DM or email to a colleague and have to wait for an answer.

##########################################

As a result, progress stalls and focus is broken. Team members are blocked until they get their answers, and the knowledge-keepers of your company are bombarded with routine questions that pull them away from more impactful work.
But Q&A acts as a personal assistant to each team member so you can spend less time searching for vital information.
Thanks to its extraordinary ability to search thousands of docs in seconds, Q&A gives team members what they need, in a fraction of the time it takes to DM your colleague and get a response.
## Ask your Q&A assistant anything
Whenever a question about work arises, you can consult Q&A first to find out if the answer is already documented in Notion.

##########################################

To open Q&A, click on the sparkle in the bottom right of your Notion window and start typing your request into the text box as a naturally-worded question.
Q&A can surface relevant content from pages you have access to, summarize the main takeaways from one or more pages, and even answer more complex specific questions about what the content means.

##########################################

You can ask Q&A to:
- Search for mentions of a particular topic across the workspace For example, asking Q&A to find mentions of plans for new user education which might surface training materials for employees.
- Answer onboarding questions Even the most robust onboarding page will lead to questions. Q&A is an onboarding buddy for your new hires to ask anything, from how to set up their 401k, to what to do when they get locked out of the office.

##########################################

- Get up to date with a meeting you missed Couldnt make yesterdays standup? Ask Q&A to summarize what was discussed and find tasks assigned to you after the meeting.
- Suggest explanations for results of a campaign Seen unusually fast growth in one market? Q&A can help you make sense of results. Ask why have we experienced such high organic growth in Korea?. It can look at the results of marketing campaigns, paid ads, user research and client feedback that relates to Korea, and suggest possible explanations.

##########################################

With access to all the information stored in your workspace, Q&A understands your OKRs, sprint commitments, campaign goals, and everything else you use Notion for. When you ask a question, it will provide an accurate answer from the library of information youve built as a company.
Q&A respects your security and privacy

## Unblock yourself faster with Q&A
Q&A makes AI a useful tool for everyone and can have a tangible impact on day-to-day work.
You can use Q&A no matter what team youre on. Let's look at examples.
### Engineers get assistance with technical queries
As an engineer, the last thing you want is to break your flow when youre in the middle of fixing a complex bug.

##########################################

If you need to check how something should be done, instead of contacting your manager or reading through all your lengthy process docs, you can open up Q&A and get an instant answer to your question.
Andrew Pett, Staff Backend Engineer from Remote, explained how Q&A helps surface crucial information:
The benefits for using Q&A for me are speed and efficiency. If I come across a keyword or some context Im not familiar with, Q&A is my first port of call. Itll search the relevant documents and present information back to me in a nice little summary.

### Product team surfaces insights about customer behavior and requests
If you want to know what features customers want most, you can open up Q&A and ask a question like:
What have been the top feature requests from enterprise customers in Q4?
As well as helping you locate the page, Q&A will calculate which feature requests were most common from enterprise customers.
You can also ask for specific information about project status and blockers and whats coming up next on the roadmap.

### Designers ensure projects meet font and color guidelines
You have an urgent project to ship but dont want to sacrifice quality or let brand aesthetics slip in the rush to launch.

##########################################

To make sure everything goes out looking clean, ask Q&A:
What are our guidelines for font and color usage across the website?
Q&A will present the guidelines and summarize the key points, so you can ensure the project is in line.

### Marketing teams pull up campaign data on the fly
In the weekly marketing meeting, your project manager wants an update on how the campaign is going so far. More specifically, they want to know the results of one particular initiative.
To get the requested data point type a question into Q&A, such as:
How many impressions were driven by last week's TikTok boosting campaign?

##########################################

The results are up immediately, and the conversation can swiftly move on to strategies for improving the numbers next week.

## How to get the most value from your Notion AI add-on
Q&A is used to retrieve and synthesize information from various documents using natural language. It can answer your questions using data from across your entire workspace and synthesize concepts from your knowledge library, but it doesnt have access to wider knowledge.
In addition to Q&A, Notions AI package also includes Writer and Autofill.

##########################################

### Writer assists you in drafting, editing, brainstorming and research
Call up Writer by hitting space in any page, and you can start drafting and editing text, generating ideas, researching a topic, and more.
Writer will look to the outside world for knowledge to help you draft content. It can understand the context of the page youre currently on. You can ask it to perform actions (like summarizing) on the content of the page, but it wont necessarily take wider workspace information into context.
### Autofill extracts key information at database level
Autofill is a database property that can summarize, extract insights, translate content from a database entry.

##########################################

In the context of project management, it can summarize the progress of a project or task, and the results will update as new tasks are added and lifecycle changes.
It helps you glean high-level insights from a database at a glance.

## Grow a company knowledge hub that supports team members in their work
To maximize the value you get from Q&A, your companys Notion workspace needs to contain all the information your team members need to get on with their work and understand their roles.

##########################################

If youre still building out your organizations workspace, here are some tips to bear in mind:
- Create a company home or wiki containing key information about your companyYourcompany wikimight contain process documents, company policies, your mission statement and values, and overarching goals.
- Build wikis for each team In addition to the company wiki, eachteam should have their own homepagewhere relevant resources are easy to find.
- Use our project and task management systemYou can duplicate NotionsProjects & tasks templateinto your workspace. With projects and tasks connected, Q&A will be able to answer questions about project status and workload.
- Import content from other tools If youve switched from another tool, you can import content fromConfluenceorAsana, you can import your content straight into Notion in just a few clicks. You can alsocreatesynced databasesand pull information from other tools such as Github and Jira.

# Get useful insights with workspace and page analytics
Analytics can help all workspace contributors - from page creators to knowledge managers - make information more useful and accessible in Notion.
If you create, maintain or update knowledge in the workspace, you can get helpful insights into how your content is received. So, you can check whos read the latest version of a feature spec, discover topics of interest within your organization, and identify the Notion champions who are best placed to train other users, and more.
In this guide, well show you where to find analytics data and use it to boost engagement with content and adoption of Notion in general.

##########################################

## Page Analytics tell you whos viewed and edited your page
As a workspace member, you can view page analytics for any page you have editing access to.
To open page analytics, go to the View all updatesicon at the top right of the page, which will open a sidebar on the right-hand side. Click on theAnalyticstab.

##########################################

Here, youll be able to see:
- The total and unique page views The Views graph will show you how times the page has been viewed and when, plus the number of unique views. If your page is shared to the web, online views will also be counted.
- Who viewed the page Under Viewers, therell be a list of people whove viewed the page, and when they last viewed it. This list wont include anonymous viewers who arent members or guests, but have seen your page online.
- Creator and editors of the page (Business and Enterprise Plans only)See who first created the page, and when, as well as a list of everyone who has subsequently edited the page.

##########################################

This data is useful if you want to make sure everyone has seen the latest version of a doc. A product manager, for example, might want to check page analytics to ensure that everyone on the team has seen the Product Requirement Doc (PRD) since the latest changes. Similarly, an HR manager might need to check who has read the updated benefits policy and decide whether to send another email reminding people to review it.
Page analytics can also give you an overview of how a document or database has evolved over time. You can see who has contributed to the information and when certain changes were made

##########################################

This not only helps you understand how up-to-date the doc is - it also means you can reach out to whoever last edited the page if you have any questions about the information.
## Get a deeper understanding of how teams use Notion with Workspace Analytics
IT managers and those responsible for building and maintaining the company knowledge base need to understand the effectiveness of the Notion workspace and how to make it easier and faster to access knowledge, share information, and connect with colleagues.
Workspace analytics help you do this.
Organizations on Notions Enterprise plan can use Workspace analytics.

##########################################

- Content analytics are available to all Members of the workspace for the pages they have edit access to.- Workspace owners also have access to Search and Member analytics.
To open workspace analytics, go toSettings & membersin the top left corner. Then, clickAnalytics, which is located under Workspace.
Workspace analytics are organized into three categories:Members,ContentandSearch. You can also view a combination of key data in the Overview tab.

##########################################

Here are some ways you might use each category of workspace analytics:
- Understand how well your team members are adopting Notion In theMemberstab, workspace owners can see which teamspaces each member belongs to, how many pages theyve viewed over a certain time period, how many edits theyve made over that time period and the date of their most recent activity. From here, you can spot your power users and identify less active members who might need extra support or training.
- Track how people engage with contentIn theContenttab, workspace members can track engagement with metrics like number of views, unique viewers, and last edited date. With this data you can identify popular pages and outdated content. All your pages will be displayed in a table, along with the teamspace they belong to, the page audience, total views, unique views, total views, and the last edited date. You can filter the table by time period to see, for example, activity over the last 7 days or the current month.
- See what team members are searching for  Workspace owners can view what members are searching for in theSearchtab. Here, metrics like Number of searches, Number of unique members searching, and click-through rate can help you detect content gaps (for example, if people are searching for a doc that doesnt exist yet). You can also update and refresh content to ensure its meeting the needs of your users and providing sufficient knowledge.

##########################################

Workspace analytics are a key piece of the puzzle that can tell you how people at your organization are using Notion, and there are various ways to use that information. If you want to do a more in-depth analysis or create charts based on your data, you can export your data as a CSV file.
Your most active team members who frequently create and edit pages are likely to be power users who are very comfortable with Notion. These team members could become champions of your workspace best practices, and even provide training to your least active users who need extra support. You can find these power users by looking at theAll memberstable and seeing who is most active.

##########################################

Knowledge managers can use workspace analytics to decide what new content to create, and set priorities for which documents to create update next. In theContenttab, you can sort pages by their popularity to show most-viewed pages first. Then, scroll to right to see the last-edited date. If an often-viewed document hasnt been edited for a few months, you may want to mark that as priority to review and refresh.

##########################################

# Get organized for a new semester with Notion
Going back to school can feel overwhelming, but Notion is the perfect tool to overcome the challenge and step confidently into your new semester.
Notion can be your home for everything related to school. Take class notes, draft essays, collect resources and references, brainstorm ideas, and keep all your information connected and findable. You can even use AI to extract insights from notes and research and enhance your creative thinking.
With everything organized and connected in Notion, youll be able to work faster and stay on top of your studies.
From research and note-taking to planning daily chores and grocery lists, this guide will show you how to manage college life in Notion.

##########################################

## Get started with a template to take and organize class notes
Kick off your Notion workspace with ready-made pages from thetemplate gallery.
The Class Notes template is the perfect place to store your notes. Instead of jotting ideas down in various notebooks or having a bunch of disorganized files on your desktop, you can keep all lecture notes in one Notion database and tag each page with key information so theyre easy to find and refer back to later.

##########################################

### Create a new note and tag it with contextual information
To create a new note, click onNew, give your page a title, and start typing your notes. As well as text, you can add all kinds of blocks to Notion pages  headers, bullets, checklists, images, videos, files, and embedded content from other apps. Open the/menu to browse all the different kinds ofNotion blocksavailable.

##########################################

You can categorize pages in your Class Notes database with useful information. These properties allow you to categorize notes with different kinds of information and refer back to them. When you create a new note, it will automatically capture the created date. Then, you can tag the relevant class, type of class, attach any files, and check off when the note has been reviewed. You can click on any of these properties and edit to reflect your classes.
### Add new properties to organize your notes
To add a new property, open one of your notes and click+ Add new property. This will open a menu where you can choose from Notions range of properties.

##########################################

Here are some ways you might use properties to categorize your class notes:
- Give your notes a Status Use theStatusproperty to mark your note asNot started,In progress, orDone, so you can see whether notes are finished or still need work.
- Categorize your notes by topic Use aSelectorMulti-selectproperty to add topic categories to your notes. This comes in handy later, as youll be able to filter your database to show all notes about a certain topic.
- See when you last edited your note TheLast editedproperty shows when you last made changes to a page and can help you understand how up-to-date the content is.
- Connect notes to a course or project With aRelationproperty, you can connect one database to another. So you could, for example, connect class notes to a projects database. Then, when you want to work on that project, youll find all the relevant notes in one place.
- Get an automatic summary of your note Adding anAI Summaryproperty to your database will generate an automatic summary of the page contents. So, youll be able to get an idea of what each note contains with just a glance at the database.

##########################################

Level up with classes before school starts

### Sort, filter, and view information in different ways
Adding properties to your notes means that you will be able to sort and filter the database content based on different criteria.
Use theSortfeature to change the order that items appear. If you sort by Created date, notes will appear in chronological order. Sorting by Class or Type will arrange your notes according to those properties.

##########################################

You can also filter the database to only show a subset of the content according to how properties are completed. So, if you only want to see notes related to one class, click on Filter. Then, in Class, check the class you want  LIT 455, for example. Now, the database will only show notes where youve tagged LIT 455 as the relevant class. The rest of the notes remain in the database, and you can turn off the filter anytime.
To take this further, you can create new views for different filtered groups of information. So, you could have a separate database view for each class and one for all notes.

##########################################

To create a new view, click on the + symbol next to views. Select the type of view you want (board, list, table, etc.), and you can then choose how information will appear in that view using filters and sorts.
Here are some helpful ways you could filter and sort your database:
- View all unfinished notes Filter to show all notes where the Status property is not Done.
- See all notes about a topic To view all your class notes about a particular topic, filter to show the topic or topics.
- Create a Class by class view of all notesAdd a new view and sort the database by course. Now, all notes will be grouped together according to the class they relate to.

##########################################

## Collect all your resources and references
An important part of your studies is collecting and consuming content, which youll need to reference later on when it comes to writing essays and your dissertation.
In Notion, you can save resources from the web straight to a database in one click and enter all the relevant information that will make it easier to reference in your work.
### Save and categorize resources with the web clipper
To collect resources or build a reading list in Notion, first create a new database page in Notion - you could call it Resources.
Next, download theWeb Clipperextension for your chosen browser. Once you've installed the Web Clipper, you'll see a Notion button appear to the right of your browser search bar.

##########################################

Anytime youre on a web page, you can click the icon to save the page Notion. You can select your Resources database as the place to save the content. When you save a web page, text and images from the web will be brought over to the page, so you can read the content in Notion.
You can keep anything from research papers, books, podcasts, articles, and more in your Resources database. Categorize each entry using properties for content type, publication date, author, etc.
As with your Class Notes, you can filter and sort items in your Resources database.

##########################################

### Extract key insights from resources using AI properties
Notion AI can be particularly useful for extracting value from resources you save. There are three types of AI autofill properties:Summary,Key Insights, andCustom, and you can add AI blocks into page content as well.
Here are a few ways to use Notion AI to get more out of your resources:
- Get the main takeaways from a piece of content Use theKey Insightsproperty to generate the main takeaways from any resource youve saved. This will help you sort through the most valuable articles youve saved.
- Read a simplified version of the text You can ask Notion AI to simplify the text to make it easier to digest. Just highlight the text, clickAsk AIand selectSimplify language.

##########################################

- Translate or summarize in another languageIf youve saved an important resource thats not in your first language, you could ask Notion AI to translate the whole piece or just provide a summary in your language. Either highlight the text and ask AI to translate, or, using a Custom AI property, prompt Notion AI to Write a summary of this page in Korean, for example.
- Automatically highlight keywords Again using aCustom AIproperty, this time, you can prompt Notion AI to highlight the key words from a piece of text, or categorize the content in one or two words.
Go further with AI
Notion has a built-in AI assistant that can help you improve your writing, check spelling and grammar, brainstorm ideas and more. Discover Notion AIhere.

##########################################

### Link resources to your work so its simpler to reference later
Relations are Notion properties that allow you to connect databases, so you can create links between information in those databases.
By linking your resources to other Notion databases, you can make sure you have all the necessary materials readily available for your work, and also make the job of adding references to your thesis less confusing.

##########################################

To add aRelationproperty, go to+ Add new propertyin the Properties menu and selectRelation. There, choose the database you want to connect to. You could connect your Resources database to your Class Notes, and this would allow you to link reading material to each note. If you had a database for drafting chapters of your thesis, you could also link this to your Resources databases, so you can attach Resources as you go chapter by chapter.
Instead of painstakingly going back to search for all your references at the end of a project, in Notion, you can attach sources to your drafts as you go, so nothing gets lost or forgotten.

##########################################

## Organize college life
Your first experience of living independently can be daunting. Youre suddenly responsible for so many areas of your life  groceries, cooking, cleaning, socializing, extracurriculars, and sticking to your student budget.
Notion is ideal for juggling the demands of college and will help you keep on top of everything you have to do.

##########################################

Here are some ways to use Notion for everyday life:
- Schedule household chores Sharing a place with fellow students is both exciting and challenging. Avoid potential conflicts over chores by keeping track of everyones responsibilities in Notion. Invite your roommates to a shared Notion page and keep a list of chores, either as a simple checklist or a database.
- Create a homepage for your hobby or extra-curricular groupYou can share Notion pages with anyone you like simply by opening theSharemenu and adding their email address, and you can decide the level of access theyre allowed. Createa homepage for your club or extra-curricular groupin Notion, and keep resources, notes, and information for everyone, whether its your book club or hockey team.

##########################################

- Keep track of tasks to do Make yourto-do listin Notion by creating a list or table database with a checkbox property to tick off tasks once theyre done. You can categorize tasks according to whether they relate to school, home, family, etc.
- Manage your budgetTrack your income and expensesin Notion to make sure you dont go over budget. Tag expenses and income in a table database and review how much youre spending every month.
- Create meal plans and shopping lists If youre on a budget, you probably want to avoid constantly ordering takeout. Instead,plan your weekly mealsin Notion and get all the ingredients you need to pick up from the store. Ask Notion AI to suggest different types of recipes (easy, healthy, vegan, etc), then ask for the list of ingredients for each recipe.

## Manage your calendar's scheduling settings
Whether you're booking multiple coffee chats or making sure your calendar stays conflict-free, Notion's scheduling settings help you manage your time blocks in one simple place.

##########################################

### Streamline multiple bookings with one share link
Notion Calendar makes it easy to create multiple time slots for meetings like office hours through a single share link. The share availability link stays active as long as there are open time slots, allowing multiple people to book meetings through the same link. This means you can share one scheduling link that remains active until all future time slots are filled. Learn how to create a share link by visiting ourreference article.

### Avoid conflicts across multiple calendars
Juggling multiple calendars can be tricky. With separate work and personal calendars, it's challenging to coordinate everythingmaking sure your last meeting doesn't clash with your evening run, or your doctor's appointment doesn't overlap with an important one-on-one. Having multiple calendars makes it even harder to share your availability for activities like coffee chats or consultation hours. That's where Notion Calendar's conflict avoidance setting comes in handy. When enabled, your share availability link will automatically show time slots that don't conflict with "busy" events on your chosen calendar(s).

##########################################

Here's what counts as a "busy" event:
- A focus time or out of office event
- A meeting where you've respondedaccepted(yes) ortentative(maybe)
- An event you created or organized
When you're setting up your share availability, you can turn onconflict avoidanceto keep your schedule in check. To enable this feature:
- Clickshare availabilityin the right menu
- Turn onavoid conflictsunder your main calendar and select which calendars to keep in sync
With this handy setting, your scheduling link automatically updates to show only times that don't clash with your existing meetingsjust refresh the link to see what's available.

##########################################

### Reschedule or cancel meetings through the same link
Participants can easily reschedule or cancel their meetings using a link in the event description. This link directs them to a simple booking page where they can select a new time or cancelmaking schedule changes quick and effortless.

# Getting started with Notion Mail
Email hasn't changed much since the early 2000s, but the way we work sure has. These days, everything flows through our inbox from closing deals and helping customers to setting up meetings (not to mention lots and lots of junk). But traditional inboxes just weren't built for modern work. They get cluttered fast and eat up time with manual tasks that could be spent on what matters.

##########################################

That's where Notion Mail comes in. We've reimagined email from the ground up to create an inbox that works the way you do bringing together Notion's flexibility with powerful AI. Whether you want to hit inbox zero, build better customer relationships, or put those repetitive tasks on autopilot, we've got the tools to make email work for you.
In this guide, youll learn how to

##########################################

- Organize your inbox however you want Let Notion AI handle the busywork of managing your inbox. Tell it what matters to you, and it'll automatically sort your emails so the right messages float to the top.
- Personalize your inbox to your work Set up custom views that reflect how you work best, whether you like to sort by urgency, sender, or any other priority.
- Create reusable responses with snippets Save your go-to responses as snippets and let Notion AI help craft thoughtful replies, so you can focus on your most valuable work.
- Use built-in scheduling Set up meetings directly from your inbox, eliminating the ping-pong of finding the perfect time between multiple tools.

##########################################

## Set up your perfect inbox in three simple steps
Managing a busy inbox can be challenging. While traditional email tools rely on simple labels and folders, today's work needs a smarter approach. With Notion Mail, you can organize your inbox in a way that helps you focus on what matters most.

##########################################

### For example, if you manage a startup, you might want your inbox to show investor emails first saving you from digging through less urgent messages. With views, you can quickly spot what needs your attention. Heres how:
1. Use filters to hide the noise
Filters help you cut through the clutter and focus on what matters. Navigate to the top right of your inbox to access the filter icon. You'll find familiar options like "read" and "unread," plus some favorites from Notion databases like the "select" property for custom tags. Looking for calendar invites? There's a filter for that too! You can mix and match filters to organize your inbox exactly how you need it.
Create custom tags using the select property
Click to expand

##########################################

### 2. Group emails on how you work best
Using theGroup byoption takes organization even further by providing common ways to structure your inbox. You can group emails by domain or sender  perfect for keeping track of messages from key clients or stakeholders. You can also group by priority, which is ideal if you use your inbox as a task list. You can also customize priority tags however you want.
After playing with groups and filters, save your favorite setups as views to quickly get the inbox snapshot you need.

##########################################

### 3. Play around with flexible grouping to set your perfect view
Now that youre familiar with groups and filters, it's time to save your setup as a customized view. To get started, click the+option underViewsin the left sidebar to create a new view. You can either start from scratch or pick from our pre-built templates.

##########################################

Here are three powerful views that'll help you stay on top of what matters most:
- Prioritize based on contactsBeing available and responsive to people who impact your work the most is often the top priority. Let's say you're a founder who needs to stay on top of partner emails. You can quickly set up a view by grouping emails by sender or domain, add your key partner, and just like that, you have a dedicated space to track all their messages.

##########################################

- Categorize based on urgency If you deal with lots of emails as a sales professional, you'll want an easy way to track important leads. Create a new view using the "sales" template to automatically organize emails from key domains related to potential deals. You can then add additional tags to quickly identify which messages need urgent attention and which can wait.
- Organize based on action itemsIf your inbox doubles as your task list (like many project managers), you'll love our priority-based views. Once you start tagging your emails (more on that later), they'll automatically sort into an easy-to-follow task list that clearly distinguishes urgent messages from non-urgent ones.

##########################################

Whether you choose to create a customized view from scratch or use one of our pre-built view templates, you can tweak them until theyre perfect for your workflow. Since everything saves automatically and you can create unlimited views, don't hesitate to set up as many as you need!

##########################################

## Use Notion AI to automatically label emails
Your inbox should be smarter and free of little annoyances, like manually labeling emails. Notion Mail is powered by AI to automatically do the heavy lifting for you. Look for theauto labelbutton in the top right corner of your inbox. Tell Notion AI what matters to you, and it'll handle your email sorting  no more manual work needed. It learns your preferences and tags incoming emails just the way you want them, freeing up time for what really counts.

##########################################

Here are three ways you can ask Notion AI to label your incoming emails:
- Label emails from specific domainsSay you frequently receive automated emails from delivery services, subscription notifications, and other services that you'd rather keep organized but out of focus. You can tell Notion AI to spot these domains and label them for you automatically.

##########################################

- Tag emails from specific peopleWant to make sure you never miss an email from your boss or leadership team? Just tell Notion AI who's important to you, and it'll automatically flag these emails in a dedicated view. You can even group them by priority to stay extra organized. So when your Product lead sends you an urgent update, you'll know right away.
- Tag emails with specific phrasesYou can ask Notion to tag all emails containing action words like "Action Required," "Urgent," "Important," "Needs reply," or "To do"
In just a few quick prompts, watch as your inbox organizes itself using Notion AI. Let it handle the routine tasks while you tackle what truly moves your work forward.

##########################################

## Writing made more powerful with Notion AIs writer
Writing emails can sometimes feel like a chore. Coming up with the right words, getting the tone correct , and making sure everything's clear it takes time and energy. With Notion Mail, you can use Notion's powerful AI writer as your writing companion. Whether you're sending a quick update or crafting a detailed proposal, it helps you write with clarity and confidence, making the whole process feel effortless.

##########################################

### Craft the perfect response and save them as snippets
Imagine you're managing recruitment and receiving numerous job applications daily. You might get emails asking about open roles or checking on application status. While you want to reply quickly, the volume can be overwhelming. Plus, you notice you're writing similar responses over and over. Here's how Notion AI's writer can help streamline your workflow
- Choose from suggestionsWhen you open an email, Notion AI suggestshelpful promptsto help you respond faster. For example, when a candidate asks about their application status, you can select from pre-writtenquick replies.

##########################################

- Edit your content like you would in NotionUsing the familiar Notion experience, customize your response with titles, highlighted text, colored fonts, and attachments. Access these features using the/ command. Check out ourreference articlefor more details.
- Craft a beautiful responseWhen you receive a unique question about your company, let Notion AI draft a response instead of starting from scratch. You can even enhance your reply by "@" referencing your company wiki (link to a Notion page) or style guide to ensure consistency.

##########################################

- Save everything as snippetsWhen you craft a response you love, save it as asnippetto reuse later. Simply click the {} icon in the bottom right of your composer, select + New snippet, add a title and content, then hit save.
Keep your snippets rich with context

##########################################

### Scheduling made easy
As a busy professional, you probably spend a lot of time scheduling meetings and calls. Rather than jumping between different scheduling tools, you can now handle everything directly in your inbox. Thanks to Notion Mail's integration with Notion Calendar, you can quickly set up meetings while keeping your schedule in view. Our newsmart scheduling buttonmakes this process seamless. Here's how:
- In your composer, click the calendar icon in the bottom right corner
- Drag your mouse to select the time blocks when you're available
- Click outside the box to automatically generate aSchedule herelink
- Include this link in your email message. When recipients click it, they'll see a simple calendar interface to schedule the meeting

##########################################

Our goal is simpleturn email from something stressful into a tool that helps you focus on what matters. Just as we've reimagined every other aspect of modern work, weve reinvented your email experience to be smarter, faster, and more aligned with how you actually work. Because when your inbox works with you, not against you, there's no limit to what you can accomplish.

##########################################

# Getting started with page customization
- Notion can be whatever you want it to be: an online notebook, a project managing tool, or a to-do list. And, it can look beautiful.
- To make your pages more visually appealing, add page icons and cover images.
- For more digestible information in your pages, try transforming some of your content into quotes, headings, and callouts. Click on any content types six-dot icon, thenTurn Into, and make a selection from the list.
- Alternatively, add background colors to section headings to make them stand out, and use images, videos or GIFs for pretty visual cues.
- You can easily move content blocks around a page, and place them next to each other to create columns. Click on their six-dot icon to drag and drop, using the blue lines to guide you.
- A nicely designed Notion page can go a long way, helping bring to life your work and the team behind it.

##########################################



##########################################

# Getting started with projects and tasks
In Notion, project and task management lives alongside your docs, notes and company knowledge. Instead of switching between tools, losing focus and efficiency, team members will find everything they need to get work done in one place.
Leaders can oversee their teams progress, and different departments can collaborate with clarity - from the high-level goals that drive each objective to granular tasks that move projects forward.
Starting with a projects & tasks template thats ready to go, you can create a fully customized system that suits the way you work best. In this guide, well show you whats possible with task and project management in Notion.
Go straight to the templates

##########################################

Check out our in-app template pickerhere.
## Getting to know Projects & Tasks
There are few things more important than managing your teams projects and tasks. After all, you need an efficient system to get things done, and track what gets done.
But you dont want your employees relying on memory to know what tasks they have to do. You need a reliable system that all employees trust and use, where nothing slips through the cracks, gets missed or forgotten.
Plus, leaders need a high-level view of whats going on so they know how much work each team member has on their plate and how close projects are to completion.

##########################################

With Notions Projects & Tasks databases, project management is straightforward and intuitive. You can manage everything you and your team need to do without wasting time navigating an overly complex system or jumping back and forth between tools. Connecting all aspects of the work, from meeting notes to documents, means everyone has access to relevant information and context.
### Adding a project tracker in Notion
The Projects and tasks template is only available in the Notion app, so to start a project tracking system from the template, go toTemplatesin the sidebar.
Your system cant be too clunky or process-heavy, and should facilitate getting on with what matters (the work), not slow down the team with too much admin.

##########################################

There are three built-in project management templates in Notion, each with a designated use case in mind. Regardless of which one you start with, youll be able to customize it by adding more properties later on.

##########################################

- To-do list This is a single database for simple task management where you can create, organize, and track your tasks. Its best used for one-off projects or individual task management where you want to keep your system as minimal as possible.
- Projects & tasks Ideal for team project management, these databases allow you to organize tasks by project and track progress across your team. Projects and tasks are two separate but related databases. You can record different information in each database and link them with one another.
- Projects, tasks & sprints Selecting this template adds another layer to your projects and tasks, allowing you to arrange tasks into time-boxed sprints, ideal for project and issue tracking for engineering teams.

##########################################

## Tour the template
Large projects become more manageable as you break them down into smaller chunks and assign tasks to different team members. Having your tasks and projects connected means every task can form part of a larger objective, and youll see your projects move forward with every completed task.
When you add new tasks or projects to the database, you can outline task details and scope projects directly in the database page. This means pertinent information related to each task and project is always within everyones reach.

##########################################

Here are some things to know about how tasks and projects relate to each other:
- Projects are the parent of tasks One project can have many tasks, but each task should only relate to a single project. You can think of tasks as stepping stones towards completing a project.
- Projects have project properties Your projects have properties like status, people, related tasks, and related task completion percent.
- Tasks have task properties Tasks have properties for the assignee, due date and status.
- Project progress is measured by completed tasks The completion property calculates the number of completed tasks per project and displays the percentage as a progress bar.
- Tasks can also relate to sprints If you are using Tasks, Projects & Sprints, youll have a relation between tasks and sprints. This means you can add tasks to do to your current sprint, giving everyone a clear set of objectives for the sprint.

##########################################

### Permissions
When you add Projects & Tasks to a teamspace, everyone in the teamspace has access to those databases. This means that the whole team has visibility into what they need to do, and can take an active role in logging their progress in the database.
Read our fullpermissions guideto see how permissions work in teamspaces.
## Customizing your project tracker
Notion gives you the flexibility to visualize the same information set in different ways. You can create contextual views to focus on whatever matters in the moment, whether it be a view of one persons assigned tasks, tasks grouped by their parent project, or everything due in the next 7 days.

##########################################

### Each database has multiple views for different contexts
The projects database should be your home for general management since all tasks should relate to a parent project.
You can use task views when you want to dive into your day-to-day work.

##########################################

The projects database comes with views that allow you to:
- See active projects in a kanban board view The Active view hides all projects that arent marked as Planning or In progress to focus on and manage active projects.
- View only your projects  Mine view filters the database to show projects that youre tagged in dynamically. Selecting Me rather than your name means this filter will apply to whoever is logged in and viewing the database at the time.
- Get an overview of all projects The All table layout shows everything in the database. This view is useful for making bulk changes or getting a sense of all properties related to multiple projects.
- Assess workload with Timeline view Here, youll see your projects arranged according to start and end date. By seeing how commitments overlap, you can make sure the workload is balanced and judge your teams capacity for new projects.

##########################################

In the tasks database, youll have views where you can:
- See tasks grouped by their parent project The By project view splits your task list by related project.
- View all tasks assigned to you  In Mine, the database is filtered to show only tasks assigned to Me (just like in the projects database, this is a dynamic property depending on who is logged in and viewing the database.)
- Arrange tasks by assignee The People view is ideal for giving managers a view of each team members to-do list.
In both databases, you can create any new views that you and your team would find helpful.
### Use suggested properties tailor-made for project management
To add a new property to the database click on options,Properties, and+ New property.

##########################################

Youll see that the Projects & Tasks template has some suggested properties designed specifically forproject management.so/product/projects. Here are some ways to use these properties:
- Assign a priority score to projects and tasks Using the priority property, you can create different priority scores (Low, Medium, High, or P0, P1, P2) and then sort items by their importance.
- Tag different types of tasks Using the Task type property, you can create tags for different kinds of tasks. You could even create a view based off of these tags, handy for task batching.
- Give projects a description Add a text property to your projects database where you can write a short description of the project. This is easy for everyone to view at a glance.
- Assign a reporter to a task or project If youre using these databases for issue reporting and fixing, the reporter is a Created by property which will record the person who first noticed the bug.

##########################################

### Build your own properties
Using any of Notions property types, you can build your own properties specific to your teams needs.

##########################################

For example:
- Create a relation to GitHub task board You can create synced databases to pull GitHub tasks into Notion. If you relate this synced database to your task board, you can pull through tasks from GitHub into your tasks database.
- Build a RICE impact formula for project prioritization Use 4 separate properties: Reach (number), Impact (high, medium, low), Confidence (percentage) and Effort (number). Then you can create a formula in Notion to calculate a projects score according to the RICE framework. We have a step-by-step guide on how to do thishere.
- Let coworkers or the public upvote tasks Using a formula, you can create anupvote propertyin your Tasks database and let your team members vote to decide on the priority of tasks.

##########################################

### Level up with custom layouts
You have several options for how to view the information in databases. You can change the database layout by going to the options menuandLayout.
Choose from table, board, timeline, calendar, list or gallery layouts. Within one database, you can create multiple views, each with a different type of layout.
So, your projects database might have a table, a board and a timeline, while your tasks database could contain a list, a board and a table.
Each of these layouts can then be filtered and sorted in different ways to create shortcuts to view a sub-section of the information in the database.
You can learn more about database properties and viewshere.

# Grow with quality using these systems to track applicants and onboard new hires
Setting up systems for tracking applicants and onboarding new employees is the most high-leverage thing HR professionals can do for their company. You're on the front lines of growth and setting up new employees for success  challenges that pay longterm dividends once you're able to juggle all the balls associated with these processes.

##########################################

Here, we'll show you step-by-step how to build the foundation for two systems in Notion that are tailored specifically to human resources and people ops teams: one for tracking applicants, one for onboarding. We've seen them have incredible impact for teams who are able to find the right talent and give them the tools they need to flourish.
### In this piece, you'll learn
- 1To create two databases  one for applicant tracking and one for onboarding that systemize your processes for scale.
- 2To organize and customize these databases to meet your team's needs.
- 3Best practices from the Notion People Ops team for more effective hiring and onboarding.

##########################################

## Pretty soon, you'll have two systems that look like this:
What are your current systems for hiring and onboarding?
Do you have them? Can they be better?

##########################################

People are your company's heartbeat. But you're the eyes.You need a system that sees where applicants are coming from and charts the course for how employees move forward once they're part of your company. Setting up these processes can be difficult, especially with the unique set of problems HR teams face when it comes to hiring and onboarding:
- Information overload during hiring materials, notes and data about candidates come from everywhere throughout the hiring process, from phone screens to onsite interviews to sample work and resumes. Not having a system means you might miss vital info you need to make an important team decision.
- There's no onboarding process at all without a system, important docs and tribal knowledge aren't passed to new employees. There's no way to know which new employee has completed what, and what they still need to do.
- New hires don't feel like part of the team this is especially true for remote teams. Avatars from online profiles don't have much life. Plus, there's no good way to share your company culture or best practices with new employees digitally.

##########################################

In Notion, you can create custom processes for hiring and onboarding, and keep all information about candidates and documents centralized in one place.

##########################################

- One system for everything you need resumes, portfolios, references, test projects and everything related to a candidate or employee are packaged in one place. Pages inside your project tracker hold all the information you and your team need to make decisions.
- Every aspect is totally customizable mold Notion to how you work, like setting your interview schedules or onboarding steps. And as your company grows and processes change, all these aspects can be easily updated.
- Company-wide transparency with centralized hiring and onboarding info, anyone at the company can quickly access it. Checking on the status of a referral or seeing where the new engineer is at in their onboarding makes the entire organization part of the process.

##########################################

Someone's journey with your company starts the moment they consider applying. With Notion, you can create a branded, consistent, high-quality experience all the way from application to onboarding, setting the foundation for your growth by establishing a solid process.
## How to set up your hiring and onboarding systems
Your applicant tracker and new hire onboarding systems are two different databases built on the same foundation. The applicant tracker will help you move potential hires through your recruiting process. Similarly, the onboarding system will help you set a process where new hires get oriented with all the appropriate materials.

##########################################

With them, you'll be able to seamlessly move people from applicant to onboarded teammate, tracking every step in both processes. Here's how to build them yourself.
### 1. A database that tracks everything
You can make many different kinds of databases in Notion: a table, calendar, list, board and more. Here, we'll be making a board  a collection of individual pages you can move from one stage to the next.

##########################################

- Type/and you'll see a list of things you can include in a Notion page. This is called the "slash command." You can use it to do just about anything in Notion.
- Add a new page and then selectBoardfrom the templates you see listed.
- At the top of the board are columns. These will act as stages in your process, which you can customize however's best for you. In your Applicant Tracker, they'll be stages like "Lead," "Interview," etc. In your New Hire Onboarding, they'll go from "Not Started" to "Complete."
- We've included a few blank cards in your board. Each will eventually be cards for your candidates or new hires where all their information will live. Inside each card are properties  different attributes that describe a candidate or employee. Create any number of different properties you'd like. Click+ Add a propertyto make your own.Click on a property and underPROPERTY TYPE, you'll see a menu for the types of properties you can include. Use aSelectproperty to assign a lead source, like "Inbound" or "Referral." Try aPersonproperty to tag the hiring manager. There's even anEmailproperty for contact info.You can add or remove properties easily, and when changing the properties, you only need to do it once. Edits will be reflected when you make a new page.Based on anySelect,Multi-selectorPersonproperty, you can change the columns in your board. Maybe you want to see status of new hire onboarding. Or maybe you want to see how many referrals are in the pipeline. To change the columns on your board, hitGroup byon the top right.
* Click on a property and underPROPERTY TYPE, you'll see a menu for the types of properties you can include. Use aSelectproperty to assign a lead source, like "Inbound" or "Referral." Try aPersonproperty to tag the hiring manager. There's even anEmailproperty for contact info.
* You can add or remove properties easily, and when changing the properties, you only need to do it once. Edits will be reflected when you make a new page.
* Based on anySelect,Multi-selectorPersonproperty, you can change the columns in your board. Maybe you want to see status of new hire onboarding. Or maybe you want to see how many referrals are in the pipeline. To change the columns on your board, hitGroup byon the top right.

##########################################

Boards in Notion pull double duty  they track process while keeping all relevant information neatly bundled together.This'll save you time assembling disparate notes and sources of information about and for applicants and new hires alike, while allowing everyone on your team to contribute to the process.
### 2. Organize your systems
A company's hiring and onboarding processes are as unique as fingerprints. Notion is like a set of building blocks you can use to create the perfect system for your needs.

##########################################

- Show properties in your board view to understand what's going on with your candidates and new hires at a glance, you can display them right on the cards in your board. Instead of needing to click into a card to see an applicant's location or the hiring manager, you can see all that info right from the board view. On the top right of your board, clickand hitProperties. Toggle the ones you want to display. You can even rearrange them using theicon.
- Change views for whatever you need to see with Notion, you can serve the same dataset many different ways. You can have a list of all the new hires you made this year. You can have a calendar of when they started. You can even set up views just for different teams, both for hiring and onboarding.To do it, click+ Add a viewnear your board's title. Then select the type of database you want, give it a name and hitCreate. Next, you're going to apply different filters to surface only the information you want to see in this specific view.HitFilter, then+ Add a filter. These are all related to the properties in your cards. For example, maybe you only want to see which hiring managers closed roles and when. You can filter to just see those, then hitSortand+ Add a sortto organize by start date.

Heres a 4-minute video teaching you everything you need to know about using advanced database filters.
With custom views, Notion is like another member of your team, giving you only the information you need when you need it. Even teams or hiring managers can create views they need. This helps package what was once a large dataset into more manageable (and relevant) pieces.
More properties & views for your Applicant Tracker

##########################################

Properties will help organize and prioritize all the applicants in the pipeline. Here are a few that might help:
- The role they're filling aSelectproperty where you can designate what team this person will be joining, from product to customer support.
- Their contact anEmailorPhoneproperty so you don't have to dig through your inbox to quickly and easily touch base with them.
- Website aWebsiteproperty for their personal website, so anyone on the team can review samples, design work and anything else.
- Skills aMulti-selectproperty where you can create any number of tags based on their skills, like "Front End" or "UX" for an engineer.
- Source of the application whether it's a referral, a cold inbound or a warm intro, you can use aSelectproperty to track where you're getting the most leads.With such an ocean of applicants, custom views act like a net so you're surfacing only what's relevant right here and now. Try these:
- By team a table view of candidates by team, like engineering or marketing.
- By hiring manager a board view where each column is a different hiring manager, and all the roles they're responsible for are pages filed underneath.
- By source with many applicants in the pipe, it can be beneficial to see where they're coming from. This board view, where columns are organized by source, helps with that.
- A calendar of start dates a calendar view so you can see when candidates are starting.

##########################################

More properties & views for your New Hire Onboarding

##########################################

Properties help create visibility into the onboarding process, both for new hires and for teammates responsible for certain steps in the process. Here are a few we like:
- Their department aSelectproperty where you'll include the department this new team member is joining.
- Start date with aDateproperty, you can assign a start date for new employees. This helps with scheduling check-ins down the road, like at 90 days or one year.
- Putting a face to the name with aFiles & mediaproperty, you can include a photo of your new hire so existing team members can get to know them more personally.
- Fun facts aTextproperty where the new employee can include a fun fact about themselves, like if they think a hotdog is a sandwich or not.Views are important so you can see where everyone's at in the onboarding process, no matter what department they're part of or when they started. These might be helpful:
- By team a board where the columns are different departments and new hires are slotted in each one. You can also create custom views for each team to see only additions to that team.
- By start date a table of all teammates, organized with the newest start date at the top.
- By onboarding status a board where columns are different statuses, so you can see where each new employee is in the onboarding funnel, and what's left to do.

##########################################

### 3. Every page can be customized
In Notion, customization is like an onion. It can be high-level, like changing columns in a board to match your onboarding process. Or it can be granular, where the pages nested in these columns are personalized to every candidate.
For instance, you might want to create a page for an engineering onsite interview, with information about the day's structure. Or you can share specific tools used by the engineering team in an onboarding page. These allow you to develop a completely custom experience for every potential or existing employee  that kind of thing doesn't go unnoticed.

##########################################

- Headers to give each page a clean and tidy look, consider adding different sized headers to organize your information. Choose fromH1(the largest),H2orH3. When prepping your hiring manager for an interview with an engineering candidate, you can include anH1header for "Prep" withH2headers underneath for "Background Info" and "Skills Criteria." This makes downloading information much easier for someone pitching in on an interview.
- Drag-and-drop using theicon, move anything around your pages. Pages inside pages, text, images, just about anything can be organized however you'd like. You can even grab headers and drag them all the way to the right (the blue guides will help) to create columns. That way, you can have "Interview Questions" on a left column and "Call Notes" on the right for easy reference.

##########################################

You can take customization even further with Notion's embeds. These open up a world of possibilities for what can be included in a page. Here's what might be useful to your team:

For applicant tracking
Whether it's internal pages so your team can review an application, or an external page you're sharing with a candidate, certain embeds help unite all relevant pieces of information. To access these embeds, simply type/and its name. For example/imageor/map.

##########################################

- Sample work instead of needing to leave your Applicant Tracker to review materials, Notion brings them all together. For designers, embed prototypes from Figma, Invision, Miro and more. For engineers, you can work together in code blocks, or embed GitHub gists.
- PDFs & other files resumes for internal reviewers, style guides if the applicant is working on a project, etc. Just type/embedand paste the share link to embed from 500+ apps.
- Maps when hosting an onsite interview, you can embed the location of your office from Google Maps right inside the applicant's custom prep page they receive in advance.
Want to share public pages with applicants? Watch this 4-minute video
For new hire onboarding

##########################################

Every team has unique onboarding needs. When bringing on a new teammate, you can customize the experience based on which team they're joining. To include these embeds, type/todo,/linkand/web.

##########################################

- A to-do list so you know what's complete few things are as satisfying as checking something off a to-do list. You can include a list in a new hire's onboarding materials so they know what they need to complete (and you get transparency into what they've done so far).
- Link to internal pages whether it's a company wiki, a lunch-ordering system, or any other materials you already have that this new hire will need, you can link to them inside their onboarding page for quick reference.
- Web bookmarks for external pages things like benefits information, vacation and expense policies, etc. usually live across many websites. These can all be included in onboarding pages by linking to external websites or even embedding PDFs right inside the page.

##########################################

### 4. Standardize your process with templates
From an applicant tracking perspective, templates help your team operate off the same set of principles, questions, and assessments. For onboarding, templates can speed up your process so you're not reinventing the wheel every time that, say, a new marketer or designer joins.
By setting the framework, you're creating a consistent experience. Yes, that's essential for streamlining the growth your team. But it's also essential for doing so with quality, equity, and care  especially as your cadence hits warp-speed.

##########################################

To create a template in either of your databases, click the down arrow next to the blueNewbutton. Then select+ New template. A blank page will come up. This is your template that you can format and then use any time you want.
Templates for your Applicant Tracker

##########################################

- New candidate interview under anH2header for "Notes," you can include several toggles for feedback from different interviewers. On any blank line, type>and a toggle will come up. Title each based on your review system, and inside, interviewers can leave their notes. This keeps all candidate notes reference-able without being overwhelming or immediately viewable. Under these, you can even includeH2headers for "References" and "Next Steps."
- Interview rubric inside your interview pages, you can also include a rubric so everyone on your team is evaluating every candidate the same way. Type/tableand chooseTable - Inline. Here you can make the first column all the different things you'll grade a candidate on, from "Skills assessment" to "Culture fit." Make the second column aNumberproperty type, where you can assign a 1 - 5 based on each criteria. Then, turn the third column into aTextproperty where you can leave some notes to expand on your ratings.
- Assigning team-specific projects as your team grows, you'll probably be assigning many projects to candidates. You can create some team-specific templates, like a coding exercise for engineers or a writing assignment for copywriters. Then provide the hiring team with some prompts for analyzing these assignments. Under anH2header for "Notes," tag the reviewers using the@symbol and add a few bullets about what they should be looking for when going through test work.

##########################################

Templates for your New Hire Onboarding

##########################################

- Team-specific materials along with a custom welcome note, you can include all the materials new teammates will need to start their journey with your company. Make one for each of your teams.H2headers can include "Basics," "HR & Benefits," and "Tools" (which should be specific to the team). It's also nice to include checkboxes under each of these so you know when they've been set up. To make them, type[]on any blank line.
- 30-day check-in it's important to touch base with new employees, answer questions and make sure they're getting early feedback from their managers. In their onboarding doc, you can create a new page titled "30-Day Check-In." Inside this page, use the@symbol and type@remind aug25. This will remind you to set up the check-in (you'll get a notification). Also inside the page, you can createH2sections where managers, teammates and the employee themselves can provide feedback for total transparency.

##########################################

### 5. Best practices from the Notion hiring team
Our internal applicant tracking and onboarding systems set the foundation for experiences that potential and existing employees have with our company. Theyre tools integral to our ability to scale  they help us connect with people and help the people at Notion connect with each other.

##########################################

There are so many pieces needed to hire and onboard efficiently. These systems put that puzzle together for us. Here are our favorites:
- Create a company directory a directory of all employees helps us get to know each other a little better, which is especially important in the era of remote work. It's a database with table and gallery views (see image above) that includes our Notion illustrated portraits, personal websites and emails, the teams we're on, and even things like office pets. Using aFormulaproperty, we even show everyone's tenure in months and years. The table is sorted from newest employee to earliest.Inside these employee pages are what we call "Life Stories." Each week, someone new makes a presentation about their life  it's one of our most valued cultural touchstones keeping us all bonded. These are all saved so new employees can go through and learn more about their coworkers (andsee a number of baby photosalong the way ).

These are all saved so new employees can go through and learn more about their coworkers (andsee a number of baby photosalong the way ).
- A new hire newsletter as with any rapidly-growing team, it can be difficult to stay updated on all the new faces. To help with this, our recruiters put out a new hire newsletter with updates on who's joined, which roles are open, and any other important HR info. We use a gallery database (which you can make by typing/gallery) to show employees' photos to everyone on the team. In theSharemenu on the top right of the page, we useCopy linkto circulate this newsletter via Slack to the entire company.

##########################################

- Make a job board of course we post jobs at Notion using a job board ... in Notion. You can use thisjob board templateto get started, which will include open positions and give applicants a sense of what life is like at your company. It's a series of list databases, one for each team, where pages contain job descriptions and instructions to apply. Using this is a quick way to spin up an instantly editable jobs site without the pains of web development.

# Notion for creative agencies: managing internal and client work
Running an agency can feel like spinning many plates at once. Of course, theres the day-to-day of your business, like meetings and onboarding new hires. But theres also the clients and their many projects, each with specific goals, workflows, and requirements.
Your team needs to be able to work in harmony to meet competing deadlines and deliver outstanding work. Without a clear system for organization, teammates waste time looking for information  instead of focusing on the creative work they do best.

##########################################

Notion gives your team a central hub to organize all your internal and client-facing work, from team processes to project specs for clients.And when its all in one place, collaboration is seamless, both for the teammates executing projects and the clients reviewing the work.
Well show you how to set up a workspace that unites everyone at your agency and brings clients into the loop as projects progress.
## Top-level pages to find what you need fast
Notions sidebarhelps you map out your workspace. Top-level pages appear in the sidebar, and you can click on the dropdown next to the page to see sub-pages, and quickly navigate to them. You can create a new top-level page by clicking the+icon.

##########################################

Youll want to create one top-level page for all your agencys information so everyone can access things like your employee directory, whos on which accounts, and benefits info. Each of these can be sub-pages inside your agency's wiki, making it easy to navigate for your team.
In addition to your company-level wiki, each team or department at your agency can create their own wiki. This houses all their specific work  your sales team might have a CRM, your engineering team might have their QA process, marketing might have brand guidelines. Pages are customizable, so they can be molded to the needs of each team.
Similarly, you can create top-level pages for every client, which act as the client's wiki.

##########################################

Everything related to the client will be nested within this page, and you have the freedom to structure it in any way that makes sense. Whether its their daily point of contact, communication protocols, or goals  think of this as the homepage between agency and client. It should have everything both teams need to succeed together.
### Give your clients access to their wiki
You can invite clients into their area of the workspace, giving them access to the client homepage and all its sub-pages.
Its important to make sure that people have access to the right pages. For example, everyone at your agency should have access to your agencys wiki, but clients should only be able to see their pages.

##########################################

Sharing pages inNotion brings everyone together in the right place, so both clients and team members can stay up to date with whats going on.
- To share pages with your client, go to theSharemenu and type their email address into the text field, then clickAdd people. There are different permission levels possible. Youll probably want to give your clients permission to view and leave comments, but not make changes to the page content itself.
- Another way to invite your client is to copy the page link, and share that with your client via email or Slack. If you want to know more about sharing, we have a guide explaining themany ways to share pages in Notion.

##########################################

## Manage all projects with custom, client-specific databases
Now that you have a dedicated space for every client, you can start planning and tracking your projects. Inside your clients wiki, create a project database to manage all the work youll do together.
To create a database, hit the/command and chooseBoard - Full page. This Kanban board will display projects as cards which you can organize by status. This will become one of the sub-pages within your clients wiki.

##########################################

Next, youll want to add some properties to the database so you can start organizing work. To add a property, selectPropertiesat the top of your database and clickAdd a property. These are some properties you could add to your clients project database to keep communication smooth and work on track:
- Status a status property will help you see what stage each project is at. Use aSelectproperty, and create options such as Up next, In progress, Ready for review, and Delivered. You can drag-and-drop the pages depending on where the work sits, making it easy for internal teams and clients to know what they need to do.
- Deadlines add aDateproperty so you can give your project a deadline. If you like, you can toggle onEnd dateto set a timeline for the work that spans days, weeks, or months.
- Project owner aPersonproperty means you can tag a teammate to assign them a project. You can rename it Project owner. That way you can tag whoever is responsible for completing the project and everyone else knows who they can bring questions to. Add another person property to tag others involved in the project, such as reviewers, or the client.
- Type of project use aSelectproperty and create some tags so that you can identify different types of projects. This can help you prioritize and differentiate between shorter tasks, like tweaking a logo, and longer, more labor-intensive projects like a complete branding or website redesign.

##########################################

In Notion, you can choose from a variety of database types  tables, lists, calendars, timelines, and galleries all have their advantages.The same database can even have multiple views, so you can sort information in different ways.
This means you can have a board view of all your projects, and switch to calendar view to see when those projects are launching. You can surface relevant information in a flash, depending what you need to see, which is especially helpful in the fast-paced world of agency life.

##########################################

### Templates help you jump straight into the work
As an agency, youve likely discovered processes for how to best work with your clients. Whether its a stellar creative brief or a new client proposal that considers all the edge cases, database templates can help you cement your processes so everyone executes according to plan, even as your team grows.
To add a database template, go to the dropdown next toNewin the database. Click+ New template. A blank page will open up, and you can edit this, adding prompts or headings to help you quickly jump into a new project.
We have a template for creative briefs which you can findhere.

##########################################

You can make a number of database templates depending on the recurring work you do with a client. From that creative brief, to a launch, to a press release, templates help you approach projects with a set of criteria you've already established  teammates don't need to start from scratch every time.
And when you learn something new about a process or a better way of doing things? Just update the template and those learnings will go forward with you.
## Project management runs parallel to your work
Your project database helps you manage work, but it can also be where you actually do the work.

##########################################

Because Notion unites everything in one place, your team will spend less time context switching, hunting down documents, or trying to locate files in email chains. This is valuable for agencies and clients. The time you share comes at a premium, and billable hours must be spent accomplishing projects, not wading through admin.
Every entry in your project database opens as its own, fully customizable page, meaning your teams can centralize all work for a project in one place.
Here are some things you could include in a project page. To access these, type/, and either search through the menu or start typing what you want.

##########################################

- Text draft blog posts or press releases right in Notion. You can also create headers, bulleted lists, and more to add some texture to your writing. Learn more aboutwriting and editing basics.
- Links add links as hypertext or using aweb bookmark. This is great for design agencies, so clients can share examples or inspiration. You can even useNotion's Web Clipperto send links straight from your browser into Notion pages whenever you see something valuable online.
- Media drop an image, video, document or audio file directly into the page. This lets anyone see designs, logos, or videos without navigating out of Notion. A full list of options can be found when you type/media.
- Embeds you can embed Figma files, Abstract projects, Miro boards, GitHub Gists, and more. Designers and creatives may need various tools to complete their projects, but Notion brings everything together on one page. Here's afull list of embeds.

##########################################

Notion brings all your tools together in one, so teammates can always find what theyre looking for and collaborate more effectively.
## Asynchronous communication keeps everyone on the same page
You can start a conversation with anyone either in the comments section at the top of a Notion page, or by commenting on specific things throughout the page.
Comments allow you to collaborate with teammates or clients, keeping feedback loops tight. They also save time  no one wants to be culling feedback from across different pieces of software, making sure everything is accounted for. When nothing's missed, incorrect or duplicative work is far less likely to happen.

##########################################

There are two ways to comment:
- Page comments use the comment section at the top of a page for general, high-level comments. For example, sign-off a project with a comment to say Ive reviewed the final changes and this is ready to go!
- Block comments leave comments on blocks anywhere on a page. This is handy when suggesting edits to a blog post, or giving feedback on individual designs. Clicknext to the block, and selectComment.
You can tag people or pages in comments by typing@, followed by someones name or the name of a page. You can also type@followed by the date to tag a date in your comment, which is perfect for reminders or deadlines for collaborators. Click on this date to customize it by adding a time, date range, or time zone.

##########################################

Find outall you need to know about comments here.
## Simplify client presentations
Many creative agencies spend a lot of time designing sleek presentations to showcase their work to clients. As well as taking a lot of effort, these presentations may feel static and inflexible.
Instead, why not invite your clients into the workshop? By presenting straight from Notion you can save time and let clients see behind the scenes. If you have a meeting scheduled, invite them to the page by sharing a link or adding them as a guest.

##########################################

Together, you can look through all the work-in-progress in real-time, and as you get their feedback and discuss changes or revisions, you can take notes and comments directly in the document. Not only does this save time on note-taking and task-setting, but it also helps your clients get involved, and feel like you are listening to their opinions and acting on them.
Design agencyMetaLabhas started doing client presentations this way. Design Lead, Lee Giles, says, "Notion creates a great opportunity for us to make workflow collaboration two-way between us and the client.

# How marketing and sales teams can enhance creativity and productivity with Notion AI
Customer-facing teams  have to get their wording right. Every piece of content you publish  from blog posts and Tweets to sales pitches and newsletters  must be on-brand and persuasive.
But, it can be exhausting for busy teams to achieve both the quality and quantity of content you require.
Notion AI is here to help your team consistently come up with brilliant ideas and craft perfectly-worded content in a fraction of the time it used to take.

##########################################

The best part? Theres no need to go back and forth, copying and pasting from one tool to another. Your connected Notion AI assistant is always on hand to help with your work  right in the place where you already do your work.
Notion AI can help marketers and salespeople draft anything, from blog posts to sales emails and to-do lists.
In this guide, youll learn how marketing and sales teams can use Notion AI to:
- Write and edit social media captions
- Outline, draft, and refine a blog post
- Craft a perfect email
- Extract insights from survey data
- Generate an endless supply of ideas
But first, a quick intro to the technology behind Notion AI.

##########################################

## Augment your thinking and save time with Notion AI
Notion AI works the same way as most Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology:
- It looks for patterns in a massive set of data, referred to as training data, to create a machine learning model
- It tests its machine learning model by asking a question it already knows the answer to and analyzing how accurate its answer is. The data the AI uses here is called test data.
- Over time and with more inputs and training data, it learns and iterates on the machine learning model

##########################################

Using this process, Notion AI can generate text, brainstorm ideas, improve writing, translate, summarize, and much more. It considers all the data it has access to, plus the context of the page you're on, and produces text in response to your questions.
Rate AI content with thumbs-up or thumbs-down
As with all kinds of AI technology, responses can sometimes be inaccurate or misleading.Use the thumbs-up and thumbs-down buttons to report great or not-so-great Notion AI responses. This helps our engineers improve the technology for everyone!You can read more about the limitations of AIhere.
To get started with Notion AI, navigate to a new line and press thespacekey.

##########################################

Notion AI will then ask you to input a prompt. You can ask for anything - try asking AI to define a concept (such as AI), brainstorm ideas on a topic, or create an outline for a document.

##########################################

Heres a brief overview of some things Notion AI can do:
- Create asummary of a lengthy doc Ask AI to summarize the content of a page, and it will generate a short paragraph. This can be helpful to include in many of your documents and pages.
- Extract themes from data, or create action items Notion AI can consider all information on a page and produce key takeaways like the themes, trends, or even a list of action items from a meeting note.
- Turn bullet points into a fully-fledged doc You can quickly turn a few messy bullets into a complete document with the help of Notion AI, which will fill in the gaps and expand on your ideas.
- Improve your writing and grammarGive your writing an instant makeover with Notion AI, which will fix spelling and grammar mistakes and improve your sentences. You can even change the tone to make your writing sound more on-brand.
- Generate content in a flash No more staring at a blank page or struggling to get started. Notion AI can generate text in seconds based on your prompts and refine and edit until youre happy with your content.

##########################################

Now lets zoom in and discover how to use these tools in your daily marketing and sales process.
## Using Notion AI to write better content
Writing with AI isnt simply about automatically generating and publishing content but rather, using the technology to augment your writing, expand on your ideas and improve your writing while streamlining the creation process.
Notion AI can help you automate manual tasks and develop and refine your ideas to create unique, valuable content that contributes to wider marketing and sales goals  from lead generation to closing deals.
### Effortlessly generate any content
It takes time and energy for your marketing team to constantly come up with fresh content ideas, for example, for your daily social media posts.

##########################################

Notion AI can help you come up with new topics and perspectives you hadnt thought of, so you can consistently publish engaging content and achieve your social media goals.

- AI autofill is a useful tool for extracting key information from databases, making it easier to digest valuable data.
- The AI-powered search function, Q&A, can quickly find specific information within a workspace, saving time and reducing the need to disrupt colleagues.

##########################################

# How Notion can help your marketing team stay organized and efficient
Your marketing team could be working on dozens of projects, collaborating with different teams, external agencies or clients, and using numerous tools.
Though youve started using Notion, youre still going back and forth between tools, not just paying the subscription fees, but also the implicit cost of context switching throughout the day.
The result? Information is scattered, its hard for your team to find what they need, and everything takes longer than it should.

##########################################

Notion can consolidate all aspects of your work into a single workspace, where you outline goals and initiatives, define guidelines and processes, plan projects, complete tasks and collaborate seamlessly. You even have a powerful AI assistant to help you write, edit, summarize, generate ideas and more.
In this guide, well show you the power of a connected workspace and how your marketing team can achieve more flow-state, less context switching with Notion.
### 1. Build a wiki where everyone can easily access information
If all your information is fragmented across different tools, folks arent sure where to find what they need and it takes time to locate relevant information.

##########################################

But by creating a team wiki in Notion you can eliminate silos and bring your knowledge into one central hub that all team members can access.
This team wiki, or knowledge base, will become an ever-expanding library of useful content. Team members can review information relevant to their role, and everyone can work with accurate knowledge.
We recommend organizing your knowledge base into an easy to navigate wiki format, with a home page and sub-pages branching out into different topics, so team members can quickly access information on a self-serve basis. You can arrange the pages into columns, and add more pages within those sub-pages.

##########################################

Start with our team wiki template and customize it according to your marketing teams needs. You can include brand guidelines, team directory, goals and objectives, handbooks, standard operating procedures, onboarding process, educational material and more.

##########################################

Here are some tips for building your marketing team knowledge base:
- Save time by importing your existing content Already got team docs saved in other tools? You can import Word docs, text files, HTML and more straight into Notion, as well as data from apps like Evernote and Google docs.
- Use analytics to see how team members engage with content You can use page and workspace analytics to see how many times a page has been viewed and by who, when a page was last edited, which team members are most active and more. This can help you keep your knowledge base content fresh and helpful.

##########################################

- Give everyone the right level of access to content Use permission settings to adjust which team members can view, edit and share pages. Learn more about permission settings here.

### 2. Design a custom project and task management system that lives alongside your work
Effective project management is vital for marketing teams juggling many tasks at once.

##########################################

Unlike some tools, which can be process-heavy and inflexible, Notion gives you the freedom to create your ideal project management system and make it as simple or detailed as you wish. And, project management lives side by side with your work and documents, which helps everyone to be more productive and see the full context behind their work.
Use two separate Notion databases to manage your teams tasks and projects. First, copy our project management templates into your workspace, and review our projects and tasks guide to learn how to use these databases. Then, customize your databases according to how your team works best.

##########################################

Here are some things you can do with your projects and tasks databases:
- Tag tasks with a variety of properties Properties add layers of information to each item in a database. The projects and tasks database templates come with useful properties like status, assignee, due date, etc. You can add any other properties that make sense for your work, such as a select property to categorize different types of projects, or advanced properties like sub-tasks and dependencies to split tasks into smaller actions.

##########################################

- Connect your daily tasks to projects Projects and tasks are linked with a relation property. This means you can attach individual tasks to larger initiatives and track how close you are to completing a project.
- Create different layouts and filtered views of the same database You can arrange one database in many different ways. Create different layouts like board view, calendar or timeline, and filter views to show sub-sets of information - such as projects currently in progress, or tasks assigned to you.
- Use project pages to collect project information Instead of just linking out to other tools, your work can live inside project pages in Notion. Use the project page to embed files or content from other tools, outline the project brief, attach relevant images and more.
- Use templates and recurring tasks to automate work You can create database templates to help you write new project briefs or outlines quickly. If you have repeating tasks that need to be done on a weekly or monthly basis (clear your inbox, review goals or send weekly team update email, for example) you can set a task to recur at regular intervals. This saves you having to remember to keep adding it to the database.

##########################################

You can also create more databases to manage your marketing work. For example, create a content calendar using a board layout, grouped by status. Here, you can plan and assign upcoming content, and drag and drop cards to change their status.
Or, use a calendar view database to schedule social media posts or track upcoming launches. You could then relate your launch calendar to tasks and projects so you know what needs to be completed in time for launch.

### 3. Create and organize your documents in the same tool
Most of the time, your notes and documents are separate from your team wiki and project management. But in Notion, everything is combined - youll create documents, organize them, and even align them with other aspects of your work, all in the same tool.
There are endless ways to customize a Notion page, with text blocks, columns, headings, lists, images, embeds and much more. So, you can create visually interesting documents quickly, and use Notion AI to save more time. Just hit the spacebar and ask AI to help you write or outline any kind of document and with you can get the job done fast with minimal edits.

##########################################

Create a docs database in Notion (we have a templatehere) which will become your teams digital filing cabinet. Every document can be categorized and tagged with relevant properties to signify the type of document, when it was created, by who, when it was last edited, whos currently working on it, etc. Your marketing team could use the docs database to create a new client profile, project scope, audience research documents and more.

##########################################

As with any Notion database, you can create templates pre-loaded with prompts and information to help you create different types of documents quickly. Not only does this make it quicker to create documents, it also helps you set a standard for your documents and make sure they keep the same format across the board.
You can also use the relation property to connect documents to projects, or your client database if you have one.

### 4. Capture insights from meetings, and reference them later
Meetings are an essential part of your working week - they help your marketing team gather ideas, get aligned and figure out next actions. They also keep everyone accountable and ensure progress is made.
But without carefully planned agendas and a note-taking system, you can end up having way more meetings than you need, and not getting enough value from them. Even if you do take notes, they could end up buried in an unknown file, never referenced again.

##########################################

A meeting notes database in Notion is the perfect way to get more intentional about meetings. Make sure every meeting has a clear agenda, action items and takeaways, and keep a record of every meeting that you can easily refer back to later.
Duplicate ourmeeting notestemplate to start documenting your meetings.

##########################################

Here are some ways the meeting notes database can help you:
- Label every meeting with a categoryUse select property to create different tags for different types of meetings - from your weekly sync to your daily stand ups, project kickoffs, all hands and more. You can also create database templates for these meeting types, with headers, bullets and to-do list ready to go so all you have to do is create a new one and fill it in with your agenda and notes.
- Tag everyone who attended With the person property you can tag all team members who attend a meeting. This can come in handy later when you want to check who was present at a meeting. People can also filter the database to show all meetings theyve attended (or missed).

##########################################

- Include action items at the end of meeting notes Make sure all action items are captured in a checklist at the end of the meeting notes. You can use the @ to tag team members in those items. Better yet, create a button in your meeting note template to add items directly to your tasks database. This saves you having to remember to add the tasks later and ensures nothing will get missed. You can even add an AI block in the button to generate summaries of content even faster. Learn more about buttonshere.
- Relate meeting notes to projects Building connections between databases gives you a  more complete picture of work. Add a relation property to meeting notes and connect each note to a relevant project.

## Tools for building logical connections throughout your marketing teams workspace
In Notion, you can weave together all the different elements of your work into one connected workspace.

##########################################

Here are a some Notion features that will enhance connectivity in your teams work:
- Connect relevant pages with relations A relation property links one database to another. Once databases are related, you can pull specific information from one database to another using a rollup. Learn more about how relations and rollups work.
- Grab your teammates attention by tagging them anywhere If you want to bring someones attention to something you can type @ and their name to tag them. This will notify them and therefore make sure they see it. You can also link to other pages in a block of text so easily reference other information and make it easy for readers to find.

##########################################

- Collaborate on documents using comments and mentions If multiple people are editing a document, you can leave comments on sections of text and tag people, these comments can later be resolved, which makes for smooth editing process. You can also leave comments at the top of the page and tag people.
- Bring relevant docs, tasks, and knowledge into your OKR page You can track an OKR or quarterly initiatives in a Notion page. Then, create linked versions of your tasks, projects and documents databases in the page. By applying a filter to only show relevant items, you can see exactly what work needs to get done to achieve your goal.

##########################################

- Find your way back to a previous page using backlinks At the top of a page youll be able to see backlinks, or other pages that link to that page. This can help you quickly get back to where you were or navigate to other useful pages.
- Organize your sidebar to make it easy to navigate the workspace  You can customize your Notion sidebar to arrange pages in a logical way and make it easier for team members to find information and get down to work.

# How product teams boost productivity and spark new ideas with Notion AI
Your product development team is busy creating new features, running experiments, and documenting your processes on the go. The last thing you want is for frustrating admin tasks to slow you down and hamper progress.
With Notion AI, you can glide through daily work - from brainstorming new ideas to drafting documents, and planning projects to improving your writing, summarizing documents, and highlighting action items and takeaways.
Youll be able to get more done in a fraction of the time. Plus, you can expand your thinking and spark new ideas with the power of AI and machine learning.

##########################################

The best part? Its built right into your workspace, meaning your connected AI assistant is always on hand to help with your work - right in the place where you already do your work.
Notion AI can help you draft anything, from a meeting agenda to a pros and cons list.
In this guide, well take a look at three common AI use cases for tech teams:
- Writing better docs that everyone can understand
- Speeding up manual work and summarizing long texts
- Broadening your thinking through creative prompts
But first - lets start with a general introduction to Notion AI and its capabilities.

##########################################

## Augment your thinking and save time with Notion AI
Notion AI works the same way as most Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology:
- It looks for patterns in a massive set of data, referred to as training data, to create a machine learning model
- It tests its machine learning model by asking a question it already knows the answer to and analyzing how accurate its answer is. The data the AI uses here is called test data.
- Over time and with more inputs and training data, it learns and iterates on the machine learning model

##########################################

Using this process, Notion AI can generate text, brainstorm ideas, improve writing, translate, summarize, and much more. It considers all the data it has access to, plus the context of the page you're on, and produces text in response to your questions.
Rate AI content with thumbs-up or thumbs-down
As with all kinds of AI technology, responses can sometimes be inaccurate or misleading.Use the thumbs-up and thumbs-down buttons to report great or not-so-great Notion AI responses. This helps our engineers improve the technology for everyone!You can read more about the limitations of AIhere.
To get started with Notion AI, navigate to a new line and press thespacekey.

##########################################

Notion AI will then ask you to input a prompt. You can ask for anything - try asking AI to define a concept (such as AI), brainstorm ideas on a topic, or create an outline for a document.

##########################################

Heres a brief overview of some things Notion AI can do:
- Create a summary of a lengthy doc Ask AI to summarize the content of a page, and it will generate a short paragraph. This can be helpful to include in many of your documents and pages.
- Extract themes from data, or create action items Notion AI can consider all information on a page and produce key takeaways like the themes, trends or even a list of action items from a meeting note.
- Turn bullet points into a fully-fledged doc You can quickly turn a few messy bullets into a complete document with the help of Notion AI, which will fill in the gaps and expand on your ideas.
- Improve your writing and grammarMake your writing instantly better with Notion AI, which will fix spelling and grammar mistakes and improve your sentences. You can even change the tone to make your writing sound more on-brand.
- Generate content in a flash No more staring at a blank page or struggling to get started to complete your roadmap. Notion AI can generate text in seconds based on your prompts and refine and edit until youre happy with your content.

##########################################

Now lets zoom in and discover how your product development team can use these tools in their daily workflow.
## Use AI to write better, more accessible technical docs
Your product development team likely uses technical documents, such as Product Requirement Docs (PRDs), to outline product requirements, features, and functionalities, as well as information about the target audience, user stories, use cases with important stakeholders.
Notion AI can help make product development docs simpler and more transparent so theyre accessible to everyone involved.

##########################################

Here are some ways you could edit a PRD using Notion AI:
- Expand and elaborate on your ideas You can ask AI toContinue writingorMake longerto extend the content and come up with more ideas.
- Fix spelling and grammar before sharing with colleagues To run a grammar and spelling check before sharing your doc, highlight all the text and selectFix spelling & grammar.

##########################################

- Adjust the tone of your writing in one click Change the tone of your PRD doc to fit your brand voice or make it sound more friendly, casual, or professional. SelectChange toneand choose from the available options.
- Add a helpful summary to your document To summarize, add a new block and chooseSummarize. Notion AI will generate a summary of the page in seconds, which you can drag to the top of the page.
Now, everyone who opens the PRD will be able to understand the doc and get a quick overview of the content.
## Work faster by summarizing pages and extracting key insights
Your engineering teams process documents can be long and detailed - for anyone who has to review many of these docs, including a summary at the top of the page can be helpful.

##########################################

In a document like a Request for Comment (RFC), a summary can help the reader get a sense of the context, whats included in the document, and an overview of the main points. This makes it easier to jump into giving feedback.
You can make summaries a standard part of your process by including an AI summary block in your doc templates.
To do this, go to your docs database and open up your RFC template. Hit the/command to add a new block, scroll down toAI blocksand selectSummary.
This will embed an AI block into the template, which already contains instructions for summarizing the page content. Now, every time you finish creating a new RFC from your template, you can go to the summary block and clickGenerateto summarize the content.

##########################################

Adding this block to your template saves time and helps your team establish a practice of including page summaries by default.
### Extract value from user research in seconds
User research can be a goldmine of valuable information for yourdevelopment process.It helps to explain customer satisfaction, understand what users love about your product and highlight features theyd love to see built or improved.
Reading your customers feedback helps you set priorities and decide what to build next.
However, user feedback can be long-winded and repetitive. With so much data to wrangle, it can take hours to sift through the customer responses to find relevant observations.

##########################################

Using Notion AI, you can extract key insights and overarching themes from complex texts in real-time. Quickly spot metrics, trends, and patterns, get useful takeaways about your users common pain points from your research, and start taking action.
To extract insights from your page, you can generate a page summary and add anAction itemsblock to create a checklist of things to do based on the page content.
You can also create a custom AI prompt asking Notion AI to round up the key takeaways and insights from the page.

##########################################

## Think bigger using AI
The beauty of generative AI is that you never have to start from a blank page again. No matter what you want to create, you can call up AI to help you brainstorm, outline and refine your ideas and create polished documents in a matter of minutes.
To get started drafting with Notion AI, head to a blank page and clickStart writing with AI
Here are just a few ways to broaden your creative horizons with Notion AI:
- Brainstorm new product ideas If you need to prepare ideas for an upcoming meeting, Notion AI can be your brainstorming partner. SelectBrainstorm ideasin the AI menu and explain what you want to come up with. You could even ask AI to help you come up with ideas for a feature name!

##########################################

- Scope out a project plan Once you know what iniatives your team will be working on next, you can scope out the project plan in a few minutes using Notion AI. Ask Notion AI to help you write a project brief. It will generate a rough outline that you can customize and complete on your own or with more assistance from AI.

##########################################

- Turn action items into tasks to do Quickly add tasks to your teams to-do list by asking Notion AI to Find action items in a document like a project scope or meeting note.
### Writing great AI prompts for better results
You can generate amazing content from scratch with AI tools by writing a few great prompts and follow-up prompts.
If you give detailed and specific prompts, youll likely be happier with the result. Include as much information in your prompts as possible. Explain the type of content or document you want (project scope, product strategy, PRD, technical spec, product design, etc) and the topic to be covered.

##########################################

Finally, include the format of the expected output. This is where youll explain whether you want the content formatted as bullet points, a table, or anything else!
By being specific and providing context, you'll get more relevant output from AI.
If you're not satisfied with the initial output, don't worry! You can always use AI like a chatbot and ask for iterations. Try asking AI to edit the text, improve writing, make it longer or shorter, make the tone friendlier, and more.
However, it's important not to over-engineer your prompts, as the whole point of using AI is to save yourself time.

##########################################

- Outline your review process specify with your team the stakeholders you need input from so you can avoid having too many cooks in the kitchen. Then tag them to ensure they provide feedback.

- Set a window for input move projects forward faster by specifying a deadline for feedback as a top-of-page comment. You can also keep your projects humming along by tagging someone and including the deadline to complete a task. The best way to do this as a comment is to use the@symbol to mention their name and the date on the same line. If they dont resolve the comment by that deadline, theyll receive a reminder as an update on their sidebar.

##########################################

- Guide conversations steer project discussions by leaving your own comments. Note what reviewers should be looking out for in your content. For example, if you want a product marketers thoughts on positioning a new feature on your updated landing page, tag them in a specific section.

ClickAdd iconorAdd coverat the top of any page to customize it.

##########################################

### Navigate through the sidebar
The wiki brings crucial information together on one page, and you can nest pages inside pages infinitely.
Team members can find their way around pages and dive into any topic instantly, and click the breadcrumb at the top left of any sub-page to instantly get back to the Wiki home.
But, you can also use the sidebar for easy navigation.
Click the dropdown next to your Company Home, and youll see all the pages nested in that top-level page. Click again on any page to see its sub-pages.
You can also drag and drop pages to rearrange how they appear in the sidebar.

##########################################

### Surface dynamic information with databases
Notion databases help you organize large sets of information. Assign properties to each entry, then filter, sort, group, and resurface information in endless useful ways throughout your workspace.
You can embed a database in your wiki brings to bring dynamic information onto your page.
The Company Home template features a company goals database embedded in the page, making it more engaging than a static list.
Without leaving the wiki, you can add entries, adjust or update properties, add a filter, or change the database layout.
You can insert an inline view of any other database here in the wiki.

##########################################

To add a database, click the/command and chooseInlineif you want it to appear on the page. Then, either start a new database or choose an existing database to create another view of it on the wiki.

##########################################

Some databases to add to your wiki:
- Keep projects and tasks top-of-mind Having databases for projects and tasks lets you track work in a kanban board and relate tasks to their corresponding projects. Add a linked view of your projects database to your wiki to help everyone stay focussed on important work. You can filter to show current, unfinished projects and sort them according to priority.
- Easy access to the latest meeting notes Team members wont have to dig around to find last weeks meeting notes with a view of the database on the wiki. Sort the database to show recent meetings first, and filter by attendees or topic.
- Showcase your offices and team members Organize information about team members and offices in a gallery, similar to the one in the Company Home template. Use database properties to include helpful information about team members.

### Add metadata to each page in the wiki
Your wiki is more than just a collection of static pages nested in a home page. Take a closer look, and youll see that the Company Home functions as a database.
This means you can tag each page with contextual information and change how you view the wiki in one click.

##########################################

- Make a team member responsible for knowledge maintenance Use theOwnerproperty to assign someone from the team and give them the responsibility of keeping the page up to date.
- See when a page was created, and by whom TheCreated timeproperty adds a timestamp to all pages in the wiki. AddCreated byto display the page creator.
- Understand when content was last reviewed UseLast edited timeandLast edited byproperties to see when a page was updated.
- Rearrange your Company home page Click the drop down next to the page title to choose a different view, or add a new one.
Any time you add a page to the wiki, it becomes a database entry that can be tagged with properties.

##########################################

However, unlike a typical Notion database, you can mix and match other elements on the wiki page. Text blocks, databases, embeds, files, and media will live outside of the database format.
### Collaborate and share access instantly
Notion makes collaboration simple and intuitive, and you can start a conversation with team members or give feedback on any part of a page.

##########################################

- Leave comments at the top of a page ClickAdd commentabove the page title to start a conversation about a whole page.
- Comment on individual blocks Give granular feedback and clarify information by commenting on specific blocks. Highlight the block, selectCommentin the menu that appears and start writing.
- Mention a team member anywhere on a page Use the@command with someones name to mention them in the text of a page or in a comment.

##########################################

- Prevent accidental edits Adjust permission levels of a page so only those with permission can make changes. For example, make your benefits policy view-only for everyone except HR managers. Adjust permission settings for a page in theSharemenu.
- Add new members to your workspace New members can be added to your workspace either via their email address, or by sending them an invite link. You can also invite guests to your workspace and give them limited access to specific pages.
- Members can join different teamspaces People in your workspace can join teamspaces, which are like sub-sections of the workspace containing team-specific content. Your wiki will live in the general, default teamspace that includes everyone, and you can have teamspaces for each department and team.

# How to build a wiki for your company
Imagine theres only one set of keys to your office.
When you dont have a central home for your companys information  like employee benefits, office guidelines or policies  youre basically passing around that one set of keys to everyone.
Every time an employee needs to access company fundamentals or wants to know where to find something, they waste time asking for the keys. Over time, this cripples productivity and scale.
Building a company wiki benefits the entire organization. It consolidates essential information, makes it accessible to everyone and keeps everything up to date  whether its a process everyone should follow or a document that needs to be read.

##########################################

Here, well walk you through building your own company wiki (also called a knowledge base) using Notion, and show you how it can save time and help your team grow.
### In this piece, youll learn
- 1How to create a wiki for your company, step by step.
- 2How to customize it to match your organization's needs.
- 3How to use features and integrations that are beneficial specifically for HR leaders and others who want to build a company-wide wiki.

##########################################

## Heres an example of what your companys wiki could look like:
Why a wiki is critical for every company
If employees dont know where to access company documents, then you probably lack a central hub for information. Every question about company-related materials should start at the same place  and a folder full of pages with no connections or hierarchy doesnt count.

##########################################

Your team deserves a single resource for:
- Benefits, PTO, expenses, office guidelines and more  all your policies, up to date with the latest information, so people can view them whenever they need to.
- Onboarding processes, so new employees can access (and go back to reference) the information they need to start doing important work.
- Company announcements, quarterly or annual goals and mission & strategy documents that foster transparency between executives and employees.
To be sure, consolidating these resources will save time for you and employees. Instead of asking someone, team members already know where to go for the answer.

##########################################

But other benefits cascade down from having this mountain of information. It thwarts confusion and misinformation spread, because everyone is working off the same set of documents. It makes updating canonical docs simple, because it only needs to happen in one place. It welcomes collaboration, because employees can read and revisit tentpole company information.
Your wiki is the set of digital keys to your company that employees new and old share.
## Setting up your company wiki
Lets start with a few basics and work our way up from there.
### 1. Make a workspace page
Often, each team at a company will have their own workspace page in Notion (one for engineering, one for marketing, etc.). Think of your shared company information as a team, too.

##########################################

It needs its own page. And inside that page will be other pages to help you organize company documents, plans or processes. Pages can contain anything, from text to videos to databases.
- To create a page, hit the+sign next toWORKSPACEin your sidebar. Already inside a page? Just hit/, then typepageand press enter.
- When you hit/, youll see a full menu of content options you can add to a page. This is called the slash command.
Because you now have one place for company information, distributing this knowledge happens with a single click. Instead of needing to update docs in many places, collect them all, and share multiple times, now you can just direct everyone to your org-wide Notion page.
These templates can help get you started

##########################################

### 2. Nest sub-pages inside your wiki
The beauty of building a company wiki in Notion is the ability to put many pages inside of one page. This makes for supreme organization of all your most important documents.
For example, you can have separate pages in your wiki for benefits, company policies, a team directory, or announcements. These pages all become resources for your employees  and live side-by-side the work you and your team are doing.

##########################################

- To make a sub-page inside of an existing page, type/pageand press enter. Your new page will pop up. Give it a title and add any content you want. Use the back button to return to your wiki.
- Maybe you want to make many pages at once. List all the pages you want as text. Then, select them all, click thethat appears when you hover, clickTurn Intoand selectPage.
Work and a knowledge base inform each other constantly. You can write a memo on why youre switching benefits providers in the same workspace as your wiki, making it easy to refer to at any time.

##########################################

Plus, now your employees know exactly where to go when they need something. Instead of asking you, they can find all these pages from themself. They can even use Notions search function. At the top left of your sidebar, theres aQuick Findbutton for all searches. You can also hitctrlorcmd+pto execute the search function.
Now that you have the pieces of a wiki, heres how you can put them together.
Link out to information from many other sources
Click to expand
### 3. Structure your company wiki
A clearly-organized wiki makes finding information a no-brainer.

##########################################

Every company is different, so Notion allows you to customize how your wiki is set up so that it matches your workflow and your team. Other tools feel like youre working with a slab of marble, rigid and unbending. Notion is like working with malleable clay.
Headers are the way to go. Using/again, choose the header size you want fromH1(the largest),H2orH3(the smallest). You can now drag-and-drop different pages under these headers inside your company wiki.
Weve found that columns tend to be the cleanest way to organize collections of pages.

##########################################

- To make a column, youll use drag-and-drop again. Grab theicon next to a header, then drag it all the way over to the right to create another column. The blue guides will help.
- Again using, grab any page and drag it into the section where it belongs.
- For an even tidier look, add divider lines under your headers by typing three hyphens in a row.
A category like Benefits might have pages for Insurance, Commuter, and Stipends. A category like Tech might have pages for Security and Tools.
If a new employee joins your team, think about how easy it will be for them to get started. Everythings here for them. They know exactly where to go for information and how to reference it again later  instead of asking someone multiple times.

##########################################

Even seasoned employees can return to the wiki anytime they need something. When policies change, the wiki serves as a living repository of information so you can spend less time fielding questions.

### 4. Setting permissions to share with the right people
When creating a company wiki, you might want to keep some information private, or make sure its only accessible by a few people. In Notion, sharing and gating documents happens with a single click.

##########################################

Permissions in Notion trickle down  if your company wiki is shared with your entire team, all employees can access all the pages within the wiki. So, if theres info youd like kept between only a few people, we suggest creating a separate page for that. Itll go in thePRIVATEsection of your sidebar. Once you share it, itll go into theSHAREDsection of the sidebar.
Of course, this can get a bit more complicated at the company level. You may want some teams to be able to see information that others cant. You may want a section that only the engineering team can edit while everyone else can only view.
Heres how to get granular with permissions.

##########################################

- To set up permission groups, go to theSettings & Memberssection at the top of your sidebar, then selectGroups. Here, you can clickCreate a groupand begin adding people to that group. Usually, groups are based on job function, like marketing, engineering, executives, etc.
- When it comes time to share the page, go to the top right and clickShare. Youll then see the different groups youve created, includingWorkspace accessif you want to share it with every single member of your workspace.
- For the page youre sharing, you can also choose the type of access youd like to give the group:Full access,Can edit,Can comment,Can read, orDisabled. Once selecting the level of access, flip the toggle to share that page with the group.
- Using the above, lets say you want only your marketing team to be able to edit their page in your workspace. Youd change workspace access toCan read, create a permission group for your marketing team, and in that pagesSharemenu grant that groupCan editstatus.
- If youd like to share a page with a specific person, from theSharemenu, selectInvite a person. Here, you can search from everyone at your company or invite outside people via email.

##########################################

You can also make a page public so anyone on the web can view it if they have the link. From theSharemenu, either giveCan readorCan commentaccess, then flip the toggle.
Heres a 4-minute video for everything you need to know about public pages.
And on the flip side, you can also lock a page. Click themenu on the top right, then togglePage lock. This prevents accidental edits.
The ability to control who sees what page is essential to building company documentation. Even if this means working on memo with a select few folks before sharing it company-wide, Notions permissions put the power in your hands.
This flexibility means that, while employees can access the documents they need to, you can still keep some information private.

##########################################

## Advanced inspiration for your company wiki
The most important part of a wiki is functionality. Here are a few tips to help you customize it to your teams needs for ultimate usability.
Start with an Office Manual page. Inside, it can have information about company policies, required reading, and even your office location. You can put a map right inside this page by typing/map, then pasting the URL from the Google Maps location of your office.

##########################################

Make your Benefits page the on-stop-shopfor everything benefits-related. Use web bookmarks to centralize all the links your team will need for this important information. You can even embed PDFs alongside these links (like a benefits summary). To download a PDF, hover over a file, hit theto the right, then selectDownload.
Your team wont have to go digging through their email or Dropbox to find the right forms. They can always get them right here.

##########################################

And an Employee Directory page helps the team lean on each other as resources. This is a place where you can share information about all employees, and easily add to the list as your team grows. You can even add an employees department, when they started and a photo  this helps everyone put a face to the name.
We recommend using a gallery for this. Just start a new page and chooseGalleryfrom your menu of database options. Youll be able to customize what information you want to display about each employee, like their title, location, team, favorite dessert, etc. You can also add bios, resumes, or anything else you want to the contents of each persons page.More on galleries here

##########################################

And when those employees need a breather?You can create a page just for requesting time offto make it super simple. Use a Typeform embed so employees dont even have to leave Notion to make a request. Simply hit/typeformthen pressenter.
## See it in action
Visual learner? We created a 7-minute video showing how to build a basic wiki.
## Next steps
A well-built company wiki can serve as your teams home base  whenever theres a question about company info or processes, everyone knows exactly where to go.
Its a powerful tool, and while you still have control over it, sharing that information with others will likely give you back some of the time youve spent sharing and re-sharing much of what could be found by employees themselves.

# How to build a wiki for your design team
Strong brands are built on strong design.
Setting that foundation requires consistency  your design team must operate using consistent tools, whether its a set of process documents, fonts, logos, or HTML color codes. Like a fingerprint, these assets should be the same everywhere your brand touches.
A wiki is your design teams workshop. Yes, its a place for all the tools your team needs to do excellent work. But its also a place to initiate new team members into how you work. Its a place to archive past explorations, iterations and decisions. Its the fulcrum between design and every other team at the company.

##########################################

Here, well walk you through building your own design wiki in Notion (you might call it a knowledge base), and how it can unlock a better workflow for your team.
### In this piece, you'll learn
- 1How to create a wiki for your design team, step-by-step
- 2How to customize it to match your team's needs
- 3How to use features and integrations that are useful for design specifically

##########################################

## Here's just one example of what your finished product could look like:
Here's why your design team needs a wiki
Design work is a symphony of many instruments. The right typography. The right image. The right color (for the record, its #030303, not #00000). If these assets are scattered around different apps or software, your team lacks a central source of truth, turning beautiful music into dissonant noise.

##########################################

Your design team deserves one reliable resource for:
- The important assets needed for your team to get work done  correct images, style guides and more, all up-to-date.
- Onboarding resources for new designers to help get them on the right track and contributing quickly.
- Pages specific to the projects you're working on (or if you're at an agency, client-specific pages), so everyone knows who's working on what and can get all the context they need.

##########################################

No wiki means inconsistent work  and when design work gets inconsistent, you end up diluting the brand youve worked so hard to build. But its not just the brand that suffers. Process suffers. Youve established a system that works for you and your team, and if its not documented and accessible, that process won't get followed. At best, this slows everything down. At worst, it creates costly chaos.
One hub for everything creates a culture of self-service, allowing the product team or the marketing team to access things theyd typically have to ask a designer for.Imagine how much time youd save if someone from sales could pop into your wiki and quickly find the correct logo they need for a pitch deck.

##########################################

A design wiki isnt just important for your team. Its important for the entire company.
## Setting up your design wiki
Lets start with the basics and work our way up from there.
### 1. Make a page
Almost everything you do in Notion starts with a page. Your design wiki will be a page that you'll add other pages to. These pages can contain just about anything  text, images, videos, databases and more.
To make a page, click the+button next toWORKSPACEon your left sidebar. If you're already inside of a page, hit/and typepage, then press enter.
Your sidebar just got better

##########################################

While the information presented in this guide is still useful, some elements of the sidebar have been updated  making sharing with the right groups easier. Learn about howteamspaces give every team a home for their important work.
Whenever you type/, you'll see a dropdown menu full of content options  we call this a "slash command." And as a designer, we think you'll end up using the slash command a lot to add different types of content to your pages.
Templates can help get you started
Click to expand
### 2. Nest sub-pages inside a page
The beauty of having a wiki is that it can contain main pages inside of it.

##########################################

That means you can have a page just for brand assets. You can have another for style guidelines. You can have one for team meeting notes, one for inspiration and even one that's a list of your favorite designers everyone should follow on Twitter.
Each of these pages becomes a resource for your team or anyone who needs design materials, for that matter.And everything will be in one place, so you can spend less time searching high and low for the right files.

##########################################

- Remember that, to make a page, you can type/pageand press enter. Your new page will pop up, where you can give it a title and add any content. You can even add some personal flair to your pages by selecting the perfect emoji or cover art.
- If you'd like to create many pages at once, you can list all of the pages you want to make as text. Select them all, then click theicon, which appears when you hover over the selection. Then clickTurn Intoand choosePage.
Setting up a home for all your information obviously helps your work, but there are other downstream benefits to be had, too.

##########################################

Onboarding a new designer will never be so easy  they'll have your core design philosophies, documents, iterations and assets collected from day one. They can more quickly get spun up and start doing meaningful work since they have all the tools immediately. And they have this repository of information to return to whenever they need to understand past decisions and how to approach new projects.
With all assets centralized, keeping them fresh is simple. Instead of updating them several places, you can do it once in Notion. Nothing slips through the cracks because no cracks exist.
You and everyone on your design team know where the single source of truth is.
You can even add some personality to your pages
Click to expand

##########################################

### 3. Structure your pages
Now, all your vital design information lives in your wiki. Lets organize these pages a bit so you and your team can quickly and easily find whatever you need.
Weve found that headers are the best way to organize a wikis pages.

##########################################

- Using/again, select fromH1(the largest),H2orH3(the smallest) headers.
- Now you can use the drag-and-drop feature to nest pages under the appropriate headers.
- You can also use drag-and-drop to create columns. Grab theicon next to your header and drag it all the way to the right to create another column. The blue lines will help guide you.
- To add divider lines under your headers for a clean look, type three hyphens in a row.
- And finally, useto grab any pages you want and drag them into the sections where they belong.
Every design team is different, and with Notion, you can customize your wiki based on your teams needs.

##########################################

ABrand Assetssection might include pages for "Fonts," "Logos," and "Office Photos." All of these pages can contain the most up-to-date assets, so anyone on your team can use them.
AResourcessection could have pages for "Style Guide," "Design Process" and "Tools." This way, anyone on your design team (new or old) can follow the same process and execute consistent work. They can also contribute to your existing processes, using their learnings to help the entire team.
Structuring your wiki like this empowers anyone to find the information they need without disrupting the deep focus of their fellow designers.
Instead of constant pings in Slack, the wiki becomes the starting point for all design questions.

##########################################

### 4. Many types of content for design teams
Notion is like a designer's playground. We've got a sheds worth of tools that are unique to designers, so you can stop working with rigid software that doesn't meet your needs.
Within pages, you can embed different types of content and display them however you want. Hit/to see some of the things you can put right into pages, which include:
- Images, videos & gifs
- PDFs
- Figma files
- Invision projects
- Framer prototypes
- Whimsical boards
- Miro boards
- Loom videos
- Abstract projects
You can type/and select from the display menu, or start typing the name to bring them up faster and pressenter. For example,/pdfand/figma.

##########################################

With these tools, designers can turn any page into a visual expression of their work. Next to an image might be a toggle that discusses the design process. Next to a video might be a checklist of things you need to review when providing feedback. You can comment and tag other designers to notify them of changes, review cycles and more.
And now, everything in your design organization has a central place.Stop context-switching and bouncing between tools and tabs  Notion can be your hub that connects everything, so information doesn't get stuck in scattered apps.

##########################################

No other tool fuels the symbiotic relationship between your work and your wiki like Notion does. Instead of your work existing on a single plane, its like Notion makes it three-dimensional.
Want to learn everything about comments and discussions in 4 minutes? Watch this.
### 5. Make your wiki even more visual
Your wiki doesn't have to be a collection of pages. It can also be a database, or use databases.
A database is a simple tool to structure and organize information in a variety of ways. To see all the different types of databases you can make, use the slash command. Type/databaseand you can choose from there. But for now, we're focusing on building aGallery.

##########################################

- To make a gallery inside of a page, type/gallery.
- Treat the cards inside your gallery like any other page you create  they can contain any information youd like.
- The benefit of a gallery is that you can display the information visually. You can even choose what image youd like shown on the card, the size of the card and more.
For instance, the card for Tone & Voice might contain design principles and guidelines. The one for Icons will hold icon files and past iterations and explorations. The Typography page can house font files and even web embed codes to put those fonts into action. And all of these will put images front and center, while still having all the necessary information you need.

##########################################

Once youve created the gallerys pages and included the correct information, you can choose what youd like to display on the card by hitting themenu button on the top right.
Here, you'll see a button forProperties. Select it, and inside, you can pick what information you'd like displayed on the card when it's in the gallery view. ClickCard previewand choose betweenPage content(the image you put inside the card) orPage cover(the cover image).
Notion helps you put your work on the front page, and its customizable enough so that you have the power to decide how its displayed.

##########################################

### Notion for design agencies
When sharing design work with a client, you want to make sure it looks polished, and you want to make it easy for them to provide feedback. They shouldn't have to jump around tools they might not be literate in, or need to bounce between your work and the project spec to ensure it's being executed correctly.
Notion is flexible enough to serve as the home for all your client work and as a presentation tool.

##########################################

Each client can have their own page. And within that page, each project can have its own page. Here, you can keep all the necessary documentation, images, and background context for that project. You can include a log of meeting notes and docs explaining how decisions got made. This inspires collaboration and makes for a better give-and-take with a client. They can tag you in feedback and make comments without needing to leave the page.

##########################################

- To share a page with a client, hitShareat the top right.
- On a Team or Pro Plan, you can invite them as a guest to their own page with their email.
- Or, as long as they also use Notion, you can turn onShare to the web, and thenAllow editing. Anyone you share the link with will be able to edit and add comments.
Let's say you want to show off your design work in Notion in pure presentation mode before letting a client dig in. You could turn on justShare to the web. This publishes the page on the internet so that anyone with the link can see it, but not comment or edit.

Next steps
A structurally-sound wiki can be the foundation for your design function  for executing work, maintaining consistency and growing your team.
A wiki isn't only a collection of current work. It's a repository of past learnings. It's a place for brainstorming what's next. It inspires creativity and collaboration among design teams, but also company-wide. It's is your home for everything design-related, so you can focus on building an iconic brand.

# How to build a wiki for your engineering team
With the right tool, organizing all your team's important information in one place is pretty simple.
But from where you sit now, it probably feels daunting. Information may be scattered. It may be out of date. It may feel like an overpacked suitcase, where you have to pull out everything just to find the right pair of socks.
Trust us. Investing time in building a single, central engineering wiki will pay longterm dividends. Because a bad organizational system snowballs, and it can lead to inefficient work  time wasted looking for the right thing, outdated info, duplicative projects, incorrect processes.

##########################################

Here, we'll walk you through building your own engineering wiki using Notion (you might also call it a knowledge base), and how it can unlock a better workflow for your team.
### In this piece, you'll learn
In this piece, you'll learn
- 1How to create a wiki for your engineering team, step-by-step
- 2How to customize it to match your team's needs
- 3How to use features and integrations that are useful for engineering specifically

##########################################

## Here's just one example of what your finished product could look like:
Why a wiki is critical for engineering teams
Ask yourself: where does all your team's information live? If the answer includes multiple destinations, your team probably lacks a central source of truth for documents that are essential to working effectively.
You deserve one reliable resource for:
- Code style guidelines, your triage rotation, and infrastructure information  all up to date and easily accessible by everyone on your team.
- Onboarding resources for new engineers to help them get spun up and productive fast.
- Pages specific to the various projects going on inside your engineering team so everyone stays in the know about who's working on what.

##########################################

No wiki means no hub for this information, which could have downstream effects. Information gets siloed so no one has a complete picture of what's going on. More meetings and conversations get scheduled because that information isn't findable. Work gets inaccurate and inconsistent because an engineer has been using an outdated style guide.
An organized and accessible wiki helps alleviate these problems.No more sifting through graveyards of documents all called the same thing (which are probably stale and outdated, anyway).
Everyone on your team knows where to find what they need, so your team can focus on what's important.
## Setting up your engineering wiki
Let's start with a few basics and work our way up from there.

##########################################

### 1. Make a page
This is the starting point for just about everything you do in Notion. A page can contain anything  text, lists, videos, images, databases and more. Your wiki is a page you'll add other pages to.
To create a page, just hit the+sign next toWORKSPACEin your sidebar. If you're already inside a page, simply hit/and typepagethen pressenter. Every time you hit/, you'll see your full menu of content options  we call this a "slash command."
You can also start with a template
Click to expand
### 2. Make a subpage
Here's the crux of making a wiki  you can have many pages inside of one page.

##########################################

For example, inside your main Engineering page, you can have separate pages for your code repository, team meeting notes, testing guidelines and more. Each of these pages becomes a resource for your team and can live side-by-side.
- To make one, type/pageand pressenter. Your new page will pop up, where you can give it a title and add any content. Use the back button to return to your wiki.
- To make many pages at once, list all the page names you want as text. Now select them all, click theicon that appears on hover, clickTurn Intoand selectPage.
This way, all the parts of your engineering organization live in one place.Your team doesn't have to go on a scavenger hunt anytime they need something  they know to start at your wiki.

##########################################

You now have the bones of a wiki. Time to organize it.
Add personality to your pages with emojis and cover art
Click to expand
### 3. Structure your pages
Let's organize your wiki for ultimate usability.
You can start with headers. Using/again, select fromH1(the largest),H2orH3(the smallest) headers. Now you can use the drag-and-drop feature to organize the pages in your workspace.
- First, use drag-and-drop to create columns. Grab theicon next to your header, and drag it all the way to the far right to create another column. The blue guides will help you.
- To add divider lines under your headers for a polished look, simply type three hyphens in a row.
- Now, again using, grab any pages and drag them into the sections where they belong.

##########################################

A category like "Infrastructure" might include "AWS" and "Redis" pages. All engineering teams are different, and Notion allows you to customize your wiki based on your team's needs.
Everything is accessible within a click or two. So forget about hunting for documents.Save your team valuable time by creating a clearly-structured wiki that provides signposts to all the information people need. Notion then becomes the starting point for your team's work.
### 4. Many types of content for engineering docs
The tools an engineer needs to do their job are different than other teams. Notion meets those needs so your team can stop shoehorning information into software that isn't flexible.

##########################################

Within pages, you can embed different types of content to display your information. Hit/to see some of the things you can create (among many others):
- Code blocks in any language
- A gist from Github
- Diagrams
- Figma files
- Math equations in LaTeX
You can either select these options from the menu that pops up or start typing their name to bring them up faster and pressenterto add them. For example,/githuband/math.
We've found that code blocks are especially helpful for engineering teams to share information vital to process and consistency. To add one, type/codeand pressenter.

##########################################

Click the dropdown at the bottom right of the box that appears to select which language you want to use. Type or paste in any code you want to share with your team, whether that's a command to run for deployment, or commonly used commands.
Notion's flexibility allows many kinds of information to exist in one place  so for a project you're working on, a singular page can have everything you need to take it from idea to launch. No more bouncing between tools and tabs. Stop context switching and get more done.
Watch our 3-minute video that teaches you everything you need to know about code blocks

##########################################

## Got it? Good. Now take it a step further.
You can nest infinite pages in your wiki. And once it's all set up, you can access all its pages right from the sidebar.
Let's say that, within your engineering wiki, there's a page for "Teams." Within the "Teams" page are individual pages for the sub-teams that are part of your engineering org: iOS, Android, Web, Mac, Windows, etc.
This structure ensures every document has its place so you don't have a bunch of uncategorized mystery documents floating around without homes. This also makes it easy for teams to access all the documents nested inside of these pages.
That can happen right from the sidebar with just a couple clicks.

# How to build a wiki for your product team
If your company is a wheel, the product team is the hub and product managers are the spokes. Most of them operate solo within the context of cross-functional teams, connecting many different disciplines while needing to remain connected to each other, too.
That requires supreme organization, a deep understanding of other teams work, and an ability to show everyone company-wide how its all coming together.

##########################################

With everyone working across projects, a wiki anchors PMs to the important information they need  like process guides, user feedback, and whos working on what. Without a wiki, no one follows consistent steps to solve a problem. No one communicates. Wheels spin, but dont really go anywhere, and the quality of the end product suffers.
An effective wiki connects your PMs through documented standards and practices everyone on your team can access, streamlining execution and upholding transparency.
Here, we'll walk you through building your own product team wiki using Notion (some of you might call it a knowledge base), and show you how it can save time, lead to healthier collaboration, and result in a much better experience for your users.

##########################################

### In this piece, you'll learn
- 1How to create a wiki for your product team, step by step.
- 2How to customize it to match your team's needs.
- 3How to use features and integrations that are beneficial specifically for product managers.

## At the end, you'll be able to build a wiki like this for your product team:
A wiki is an investment in your product
If youre going to build something people love, you need a wiki that enables your product team to grow and execute to a high standard. Without centralized documentation, your team will become increasingly disorganized with high fluctuation in quality.
Even if you do have guides and principles, they may be scattered and inaccessible. That's basically the same as not having them at all.

##########################################

Your team deserves a single resource for:
- Teams, roles, squads and their tasks  a directory of who's responsible for what features and products, what teams theyre working with, and how they're solving big problems together.
- A neatly organized table of past learnings from user feedback, customer interviews and projects, each tagged so theyre easy to find and turn into actionable product improvements.
- A reference point for everything your team does, which can be used by new and existing team members  OKRs and goals, onboarding resources, dashboards of data from experiments and your core product-building philosophies.

##########################################

A clearly organized wiki becomes your product's standard-bearer, holding together PMs fanned out across projects. It gives them a playbook.
Before, PMs wasted time searching for the right information to do their jobs. Now, they know its in the wiki: shared learnings, a standardized process, conversations with users, areas of ownership, goals, and more. A wiki might be the single most high-leverage resource for your product team because its the place where all your most important documents converge.
Notion makes it easy to create, update and maintain.
## Setting up your product team's wiki
We'll show you the basics, then you can build upon them.

##########################################

### 1. Make a page
Just about everything you do in Notion starts with a page. In fact, your wiki is a page in which you'll add other pages.
Your sidebar just got better
While the information presented in this guide is still useful, some elements of the sidebar have been updated  making sharing with the right groups easier. Learn about howteamspaces give every team a home for their important work.
Pages can contain just about anything  text, images, videos, databases, code blocks and more. Think of pages like a ball of clay you can shape to meet your needs.

##########################################

You might have a page inside your wiki that documents the history of your product. Itd contain screenshots that showcase the products evolution, a list of team members responsible for the changes, and a memo for each iteration, providing context for why you made that change in the first place (which otherwise might be lost).
To create a page, you can do it two ways:
- Hover over your sidebar on the left and next toWORKSPACE, click the+sign. The page will go under yourWORKSPACEsection where everyone on your team can access it.
- If you're already inside a page, simply hit/and typepage. Whenever you hit/, you'll see a full menu of content options  we call this a "slash command."
We have pre-made templates to get you started
Click to expand

##########################################

### 2. Create sub-pages inside your wiki
Your most important documents are all sub-pages inside your teams wiki. One for goals and OKRs. One for user research. One for a team directory. Each is separate and actionable, but together, they comprise the foundation of your team.
Whats unique about Notion is that your most vital information lives side-by-side the work you and your team are doing. Imagine conducting an interview with a user, and you find a particular set of questions is helpful for showcasing the problem they are experiencing. You can hop right into your teams guide for user interviews and, in seconds, update the template of questions every PM uses. Your entire team learns from one PMs experience and takes those learnings forward.

##########################################

Use a slash command to add pages inside a page:
- Type/pageand pressenter. Your new page will open, where you can give it a title and start adding content. Use the back button to return to your wiki.
- You can also make many pages at once. Type out all the pages you'd like to make as text (each on their own line). Then highlight them all, click theicon that appears on hover, clickTurn Intoand selectPage.
All these sub-pages make navigating your wiki intuitive. No more wasting time with ghost hunts through document graveyards. No more switching tabs between the info you need to get the job done. Everything starts at your wiki.
Now, time to organize it.
Add some personality to your pages
Click to expand

##########################################

### 3. Structuring your wiki
Now that your information is collected in a series of pages, you can add more organizational elements to make everything easier to find.
Of course, this is beneficial to your PMs  the people in and out of your wiki every day. But a structured wiki is also helpful for someone on the community team who wants to see how many times a feature has been requested. Maybe an engineer will want to check on the product pipeline, using the roadmap page inside your wiki. Instead of asking you these questions, other team members can quickly uncover the answers themselves.
There are several features in Notion to help you customize your wiki to match your workflow.

##########################################

Headers are the way to go. Using the slash command, type/headingto see your options:H1(the largest),H2, orH3(the smallest). Once you have them, you can use the drag-and-drop feature to organize all the pages in your workspace and put them where they need to go.
- We've found columns are a neat way to organize pages. Use the drag-and-drop feature to create columns by grabbing theicon next to your header and pulling it all the way to the right. The blue guides will help.
- You can even add divider lines under your headers for a polished look by typing three hyphens in a row underneath.
- Once that's all set up, useagain to grab pages and drag them into the sections where they belong.

##########################################

A category like "Team might contain pages for your goals and a team directory. A category like User Research might have pages for processes and a database of conversations youve had with customers. Projects probably includes pages for your roadmap and product ideation.
As your team grows, Notion grows with you.
Easily add new pages to your wiki or change information, like when you need to update your process for launching a new feature.

##########################################

Not only does Notion grow with you  but it also helps your team grow. Instead of walking your new PM through every piece of tech, every process and every guide (which are inevitably scattered across different software), give them the keys to your product wiki. They can explore the nooks and crannies of your organization and revisit this information whenever they need.
With living, breathing documentation of your teams work, onboarding isnt a one-way street. Its an active conversation thats customized to every new employee.

##########################################

### 4. Different types of content to help PMs
Product managers are often charged with centralizing many different types of content across many different tools. They need to create specs, keep tabs on designs and prototypes, understand the codebase, offer feedback across multiple media, and keep everyone informed about what each other is working on.

##########################################

With embeds and integrations, Notion can be the hub that connects all of these disparate sources of information, no matter where they live. This means that pages on your product wiki can be home to:
- Figma files so you can view and instantly jump to design concepts
- Github gists to easily share code snippets and data
- Images & videos to centralize inspiration, past work, whiteboard photos, etc.
- Loom recordings to quickly and visually explain something to the team
- Typeform surveys to capture information from your team right in Notion
- Code blocks to document code for quick reference and reuse
- PDFs to store contracts, agreements, and more right with the work

##########################################

This flexibility allows product managers to collect all the different parts of a project in a single place. Teams use different tools. Notion brings them together.
### 5. Build a database right in your wiki
Sometimes, information is best displayed in a table. Databases can be good tools for collecting and structuring helpful data for your team, like user feedback, research, meeting notes and more.
Notion makes it possible for all of this to live directly in your wiki. That way, knowledge informs your work and vice versa.

##########################################

There are few different types of databases you can build in Notion: aTable,Board,Gallery,List, orCalendar. We'll be focusing on theTablehere, which, for example, you can use to catalog user research sessions where you've collected notes.
In this setup, every row is a user research session. Your notes are in the first column underName, and the other columns are properties of that session  like the task that was observed, the date of the session, its status, and who on the team conducted the session. You can open any individual session as its own Notion page, which can be structured however you want to capture what you learn.

##########################################

Here's how this could look (also showing how you can view the same information as a board):
To add this type of database to your product wiki:

##########################################

- Add a sub-page, chooseTablefrom the list of options, and title it "User Research Database."
- Customize your properties by clicking on each column header. This lets you choose what type of property you want to use, and also give it a name. For instance, the "Task" property above is a single select property that allows you to choose from a menu of tags you define. The "Interviewer" property is a person property that lets you tag your team members.
- To view the information in your table as a board, click+ Add a viewat the top left. SelectBoardand give it a name.
- You can also filter and sort the information in your table by using those buttons at the top right. You'll be prompted to choose which property you want to filter by. For example, let's say you only wanted to see user research sessions conducted by Doug. You can also create filtered views. First, add a new view, then apply a filter. You'll be able to toggle between this subset of data and your full table in an instant.

##########################################

In Notion, your wiki becomes a multitool.
It can house everything PMs need, from seminal documents to recent A/B test data to interviews with customers. This information  normally dispersed and inaccessible  now works together to improve your product. It also connects your team. They learn as one. Its the campfire that draws in your product team after journeys with different projects.
### 6. A wiki that fosters better communication
If people have questions about anything on your wiki, they can comment or ask directly in Notion.

##########################################

You can also tag anyone else in the organization to enable better cross-team collaboration, communication and transparency. They'll be notified immediately that you need something or that they should take ownership of something.
With these collaboration tools, you and your team can hold ongoing, asynchronous conversations across teams and timezones.

##########################################

Maybe you notice that the process for tagging product feedback can be improved. In your process doc, you can start a conversation with another teammate. Heres how:
- In a page, hover over the page's title. There, you'll see a button forAdd discussion. This is like a forum at the top of any page where you can discuss its contents.
- You can also highlight any text to see the option to comment, or use the shortcutcmd/ctrl+shift+mto comment on anything.
- To mention a teammate, simply type@and start typing their name to pull them up.
- You can hover over any block and comment that way, too. On the left, hitto get the full menu of options. SelectComment. The comment will then appear on the right of the block.

##########################################

Comments bring discourse to the forefront. Anyone might be able to learn from the conversation being had or chime in. Maybe someone has an idea thats better than yours. Notion makes all this discourse visible and easy to respond to at any point. You don't have to worry about missing messages or needing to remember that one thing someone told you yesterday.
Especially when working remotely, Notion can make your team feel present together in their work, and make sure ideas, questions, and thoughts don't get lost in the hustle.

# How workspace owners can set up teamspaces for their organization
## Workspace owners guide to teamspaces
Teamspaces give you more customizability and control over access levels to content, functioning like smaller workspaces within your workspace. Everyone at your company will be able to join teamspaces that are relevant to their role, and structure their sidebar to best fit their individual working needs. As an admin, youll have some additional security and provisioning settings to consider that can be customized with each teamspace.

##########################################

If you previously operated in a workspace without teamspaces, heres what to expect when the feature is turned on for you. All pages in the workspace section will become pages in a general teamspace and youll be free to move and create additional teamspaces as you see fit. In this guide well discuss why and how to create new teamspaces.
### Precisely control permissions and access
The first decision you will have to make as a workspace owner is who should be able to create teamspaces. By default, any members in your workspace (not guests) can create new teamspaces. You can change this setting with the Limit teamspace creation to only workspace owners toggle. Toggling this option wont affect any existing teamspaces.

##########################################

Depending on how your organization approaches content management and provisioning, you may have different considerations for whether or not to allow members to create teamspaces.
Heres some general rules for when to allow all members create teamspaces (keep the default):
- You prefer to let your employees move nimbly and set up their own structures
- Limiting teamspace creation to only workspace owners would create a bottleneck in your workflows
However, you may consider limiting teamspace creation to workspace owners if any of the following apply to you:
- You want more oversight over changes in your Notion instance
- You want to have a centralized plan for teamspaces

##########################################

You can find settings and more information in Settings & Members, under the tabTeamspaces. Here, youll be able to see and update which teamspaces are the default for new members to join. We recommend only having 1-3 teamspaces as default  only content that is truly necessary for every employee at your company. As you create more teamspaces, this is where you will be able to see a list of information about each of them.

##########################################

### Give every team member the right level of access
Teamspaces create a new layer of access to provision content to individual members of your workspace. They let you be more specific about who from your organization is able to access content in Notion, and with what level of permission. Each teamspace has a list of members and at least one owner, and you can set permission levels to content on a per-teamspace basis.

##########################################

This will look different in each workspace, but heres an example. If you create a Marketing teamspace, you can give all members of the teamspaceCan Editaccess, and give all other members of the workspaceCan Viewaccess. By default, teamspace owners haveFull Accessto all content within the teamspace. Now any content you add to the Marketing teamspace will inherit these permission settings, with no further action needed on your part.
Teamspaces can help answer some of these questions you might have come across previously as a Notion admin. Heres a few instances where granular permissions might make sense for your organization.

##########################################

- Automatically provision content for new hires Once configured, SCIM will let you automatically add new hires to the relevant teamspaces via groups, making it easy for them to find the content they need on day one.
- Decrease shared page clutter Some work is too sensitive to be shared broadly, resulting in a messy shared section of one-off pages. A closed or private teamspace with the relevant stakeholders is a good way to keep a boundary around sensitive content while maintaining organizational structure.
- Increase view-only access to important company information When your tools are too siloed, its impossible to find the information you need from a different team. Converting team working documents with varied permission levels into open teamspaces allows everyone to search for and view the content, while giving editors and managers the level of freedom they need.
- Prevent accidental permissions changes One teamspace might allow members to create public pages, while another doesnt. This prevents sensitive information from accidentally being switched to public, while keeping it visible to your whole org.

##########################################

If your workspace is on the Enterprise plan, you can configure custom settings for public page sharing, allowing guests, and allowing exports within each teamspace. By default, each teamspace will match the corresponding setting toggles at the workspace level. If you would like to override a workspace setting for a teamspace, only workspace owners have that ability.

##########################################

At the teamspace level, you can see Disable guests and Disable export are matching their corresponding toggles at the workspace level. Their help text readsBased on workspace settings. In contrast, Disable public page sharing has help text readingOverriding workspace settingsand you can see it does not match the workspace level toggle.
### Set up new teamspaces
Once you understand the new security settings, youre ready to set up teamspaces for your company!

##########################################

If you already have top-level pages for functional areas, office locations, or employee resource groups, thats a great place to start. You can turn each of those top-level pages into a teamspace. Just hover over the page in the sidebar and click on the  icon and youll see a new option:Turn into teamspace. Note that full-page databases, or pages from within databases, cannot be turned into teamspaces.
Curious which types of pages make good teamspaces?
Click to expand

##########################################

Once youve created the teamspace, its time to move relevant content into it. You can still drag pages into teamspaces, or you can use theMove tomenu. Click on theicon next to any page in the sidebar and chooseMove to. In the pop-up menu, youll see the names of teamspaces listed as destinations. Note that you have to haveFull accessto a page in order to move it.
### Understanding groups and provisioning content
Now that you have your teamspaces, lets make sure they have the right people as part of them. Plus, youll be able to automatically provision the right content to the right people by using SCIM in combination with teamspaces.

##########################################

The best way to manage the membership lists of your teamspaces is by using permission groups. You can configure these natively in Notion underSettings & Members, in theMemberstab. If youre on an Enterprise plan, we highly recommend using SCIM and any groups that you have already configured in your identity provider. Once a teamspace is created, you can add an entire permission group to it. Thats it!
Need to set up SCIM in your Notion workspace?
Click to expand
Before you add a group to a teamspace, make sure to check in with the leader of that team or group. Theyll need to know that their content will be moving to a teamspace, and youll want to make sure that they are assigned aTeam Ownerrole.

##########################################

If you are using SCIM to control your groups, youll have a few additional steps to ensure that your groups are always up-to-date with your latest hires.
- Review the groups that you have set up in your identity provider. Determine which groups should be added to which teamspaces.
- If you have ideas for lots of teamspaces without clearly defined groups in your identity provider, take a second pass through and determine if all of that segmentation is necessary.
- Add new employees to the relevant group in your identity provider, and they will be automatically added to the corresponding teamspaces in Notion.

##########################################

Ready for teamspaces? Heres a checklist you can use to help your rollout be as smooth as possible:
- Revisit your workspace settings to ensure that exporting, guests, and public page sharing are set how you want them
- Revisit your member list to ensure that your workspace owners are accurate
- Decide whether you want all members or only workspace owners to be able to create new teamspaces
- Decide which pages will be converted into teamspaces, and what other content will be moved to those new teamspaces
- RequestFull Accessto any pages you might need to move as part of this process
- Determine if you will have any closed or private teamspaces
- Communicate with any new teamspace owners about the changes that will be coming to the workspace
- Check to make sure you have a current SCIM API token and that your SCIM configuration is working properly

- Sign into Asana and grant the requested permissions.
- UnderChoose Asana workspace, select the Asana workspace you want to import.
- Select the projects youd like to import.
- Select the Notion teamspace your projects should be imported into. Each Asana team will be imported into one Notion teamspace.
- You can check the box next to your workspace name toExclude completed projectsorSelect all projects.
- SelectNext.
- By default, all Asana task properties will be imported into Notion, but you can customize this per teamspace. Choose toSelect all properties(the default setting) orCustomize properties. Note that there are default properties that must be imported.
- Choose whether theStatusproperty in Notion should be mapped to yourSectionorCompletedproperty in Asana.
- SelectImport.

##########################################

What to expect when you import from Asana to Notion
Learn more about how importing from Asana to Notion workshere.

Importing from Asana vs. syncing Asana with Notion
Importing your Asana data into Notion is best if you want to move from Asana and use Notion as the primary tool for your work. The data will be duplicated into Notion, but not synchronized with Asana.
Synced databasesallow you to connect Asana to Notion without importing any data. You might prefer to use synced databases if you use both Asana and Notion for your work. Synced databases only go one direction, meaning that changes will need to happen in Asana in order for updates to reflect in Notion.

##########################################

To add a synced database from Asana, simply paste a project link right into a Notion page. Learn more about synced databaseshere
As you import, you'll chose which fields associated with your projects and tasks you want to bring over to Notion, (such as due dates, assignees, attachments, etc). These will migrate over to Notion asdatabase properties.
Your Asana teams will becometeamspacesin Notion  sub-sections of your company workspace containing each teams content.

##########################################

If your organization is small, you might want to keep all your projects and tasks in one generic teamspace. Larger companies can create a company-wide teamspace for things like docs and meeting notes, plus teamspaces for departments like marketing, sales, product, etc. Each team can have their own projects and tasks databases in their teamspace.
Asana teams become teamspaces in Notion

## Translate Asana functionality into Notion
Notion offers a lot of the same features as Asana, and more. For the features that dont come built-in, Notions code-free building blocks can help you recreate their functionality.
Here are some examples of how to adapt your Asana workflows to Notion.

##########################################

### Exploring projects and tasks
Your Asana projects and tasks get imported into specialized databases calledProjects and Tasksin Notion. These two databases are purpose-built for project management and have many helpful properties to help you organize your workload.
Projects and Tasks are connected, so when you add new tasks you can relate them to their associated project. Youll also be able to view those tasks on your projects database, sort tasks by project, visualize project completion percentage and more.
This is all enabled by aRelationproperty. Youll see separate areas for Projects and Tasks, and theyre in sync with one another.

##########################################

Anysub-tasks or dependenciesyou have in Asana will also map over to your Notion Projects and Tasks. This helps you get granular about task management, break larger tasks into small steps and understand when one task is blocking another.
### Views, filters and labels
Once theyre imported from Asana into Notion, projects and tasks each contain several views so you can see and track your work in many ways. You can learn more about these default viewshere.You can also add new, customdatabase viewsby clicking on+next to the existing database views.

##########################################

Any of these views can be filtered to show subsets of information. To filter your projects and tasks databases, click Filter then choose the property you want to filter by. You could have filtered views to show all projects that are currently In progress or tasks assigned to you.
Use theSortmenu to rearrange database items, for example to put tasks in order of due date. Additionally, and click on the options menuto group items according to different characteristics, so you can group tasks by their related project.
All about databases
Learn more about using databases in Notionhere.
### How to recreate additional Asana functionality in Notion
Here are some ways to recreate certain Asana features that dont come built-in with Notion.

##########################################

- Task reviews & feedbackAsana lets you request and give approval on assets and tasks. If your task or project needs approval, use aPersonproperty to tag whoever needs to sign off, or add an additionalStatusproperty to indicate whether approval has been granted. Alternatively, create a sub-task for collecting feedback, which will become a separate item in your database.

##########################################

- FormsYou cant create forms natively in Notion, however its possible to embed a Typeform into a Notion page, or integrate Typeform with Notion to automatically sync survey responses to a Notion database.
- Time tracking and workload mapping In Asana, you can estimate the required time for a particular task, and track time spent working on those tasks. In Notion, use the suggestedEstimatesproperty to score expected time required using a points system. You can also use aFormulaproperty to calculate how much time your team spends on different tasks and projects. First, add task start and task complete date properties to your projects. Then, create a formula property and paste in the following formula:dateBetween(prop("End time"), prop("Start time"), "hours")

##########################################

- Rules and workflows Instead of Asanas workflows, create customButtonsto complete multiple steps in one click, like adding a new task, assigning it to a team member and giving it a status. If your team works in sprints, learn about sprint automationshere.
- Goals and milestones You can track milestones in Notion by adding them as tasks. Then create a checkbox property, name it milestone, and select any tasks that are milestones. If you want to review all milestones, create a view that filters for milestones. To create goals and link them to your projects and tasks, copy the OKR and goal setting templates from the template gallery into your workspace.
- Reporting and dashboards Notion doesnt support reporting and dashboards, but you can use filtered views to organize information by different properties. ARollupproperty in your projects database can display the percentage of completed tasks as a progress bar.

##########################################

## Go beyond project management with Notions connected workspace
Project management is just one piece of your Notion workspace. Build anything with code-free blocks, consolidate your work and get more done with Notion AI.
### Get granular information about project status
Your project status will map over from Asana as a multi-select property in Notion.
For more targeted tracking, you can change this to aStatusproperty by clicking on the property, selectingEdit property, and changing the type toStatus.

##########################################

Notions Status property has three main categories:To do,In progress, andDone. Within each of these, create more specific sub-categories likeTo be reviewedorEditing. This helps you give managers and team members a more concrete view of task and project progress and provides clarity on what should happen next.
Using the Status property, you could

##########################################

- Filter your database to show all projects in flight Click onFilterand select the Status property. Then, check off theIn progresscategory to show only ongoing projects in this database view.
- Drag and drop to update project status When youre in a Board view grouped by Status, move your project along by simply dragging and dropping it into the next column.
- Build a custom workflow for each team Add as many sub-categories to each Status group as you need. Teams can have their own set of Status tags according to the work they do. So, your marketing team might have Status tags that relate to drafting, editing, and publishing content, while Statuses for product teams could indicate whether a feature is in development or ready to launch.

##########################################

### Plan and do work inside your project pages
Instead of a project page that links to other tools, teams can get on with work right inside a project page.
You can add all kinds of blocks to Notion pages - headings, text, images, bullet points, checklists, videos, and more, embed content from other tools, and create tables and linked versions of other databases inside a page.

##########################################

- Standardize your project briefs and processes using templates To add a database template, go to the dropdown next toNewand selectNew template. Name the template Project brief and customize the page with any headings you need to include. Whenever you need a new project brief, you can create a database entry from the template and fill up the information.
- Draft project briefs in seconds with Notion AI Instead of spending valuable time writing project briefs yourself, you can ask Notion AI to help draft project outlines. Hit the spacebar to open Notion AI and ask for help writing a project brief.

##########################################

- Embed content from specialist tools Notion integrates with many external tools, including Figma, Miro, Github, Jira, and more. You can embed content from those tools into your project pages to facilitate cross-functional collaboration on projects that includes design teams, engineers, and more.
### Connect all aspects  of your work
Migrating your projects and tasks into Notion will cut down the number of different tools you require.
NotionsRelationproperty lets you link one database to another, meaning you can connect projects with tasks, supporting documentation, relevant meeting notes, and even your quarterly goals.

##########################################

To add a Relation property, go toProperties,+ Add a new property, then selectRelation. Then, choose the database you want to link - for example, Tasks. Toggle onShow on tasksto make the relation visible on both databases.
Once tasks and projects are related, youll be able to link daily work to larger initiatives.
- Assign tasks to corresponding projects Each project can be made up of a series of tasks, so you can assign tasks to different team members and ensure daily work contributes to progress on projects.

##########################################

- Motivate your team with visual progress barsView project completion percentage as a progress bar or ring. To do this, add aRollupproperty and select your related Tasks database. Then, selectPercent per groupandComplete. This will calculate the amount of completed tasks per project and display the result in a visual format.
- Attach relevant meeting notes or documents to projectsAs well as connecting Tasks and Projects, you can add more relation properties to link docs and meeting notes as well. This means youll have easy access to relevant notes and docs straight from your project page.
- Streamline work with sprintsWhen you add the suggested Sprints property to your tasks database, youll be able to organize your tasks by sprint, and take advantage of custom sprint planning views and automations. Learn morehere.

##########################################

With meeting notes, docs, projects, and tasks all connected, everyone has the necessary context behind their work. Key information is easy to find, as its only a click away from the project page.
### Work faster and expand your thinking with Notion AI
Notion AI can help you write, edit and create new ideas all without leaving your workspace.
With this powerful, built-in AI tool, you can get more quality work done in a fraction of the time it used to take.

##########################################

- Write project briefs and docs in minutesTurn a few bulleted ideas into a fully-fledged project brief in a matter of minutes. From there, you can ask AI to extract action items and then start adding tasks to your to-do list.
- Summarize every project and task With AI autofill you can automatically extract project summaries for high level digest of your teams happenings, no extra work required.

# Make work more efficient with database button properties
Tracking progress on your work can be tedious, and some processes, like signing off a project, approving a document, or escalating a task, might require a few steps and changing several properties in Notion.
With database buttons, you can trigger a series of actions for any database entry with one click, which saves you time, reduces the margin for error, and makes it easier for everyone on your team to complete the required steps.
Database buttons are one of three types of automations you can build in your Notion workspace, along with database automations and button blocks. In this guide, well explain how to create and use database buttons, and also when to use each type of automation.

##########################################

## Database button property
Database buttons are a database property you can add to any database. They will appear as a property, and each line item will have its own button.
To create a database button:
- In your databases properties menu, select + New property
- Choose Button as the property type.
- Type a Property Name and Label (for example, Sign off project) for your Button to indicate what the button will do. This will appear in the database as the property title and in each row.
- Click Add a step to start configuring the button actions.
Buttons can contain several steps or actions that will all take place when the button is clicked. A button can update properties and add or edit pages in any database you choose.

##########################################

### These are all the different action steps you can add to a database button can take:
Add a new page to a database
SelectingAdd page towill create a new page in a database  this can be the current database youre working in or any other database you have access to.
After choosing the database, you can select an existing template from that database or give the new entry a name. ClickEdit another propertyto continue filling out more properties in the new item.
Now, when you click the button, a page will be created in the database of your choice, with some properties already completed as specified.
### Edit database pages
TheEdit pages inoption will edit the properties of specified pages in a database.

##########################################

ChooseThis pageto edit the current page, or, if your button already has anAdd a new pagestep, you can selectNew pageto edit it. Alternatively, choose a database and edit a subset of pages in it by creating a filter.
After this, selectEdit a propertyto choose properties and configure how you want to update them.
### Show a confirmation
Confirmation dialogs can be helpful when clicking a button triggers a workflow for other teams or colleagues.
When you addShow confirmationto your button, the confirmation box will appear to everyone who clicks, providing a safeguard in case someone clicks accidentally.

##########################################

You can customize the confirmation dialog text to say something like Are you sure you want to continue? and also edit the two options a person can click to either stop or continue.
### Open a page
If you want a particular page to open when you click a button, selectOpen page.
This can be:
- The brand new page created in a previousAdd page tostep
- A page edited as part of the automation sequence
- Any other page in the workspace
## How to use database buttons to streamline workflows
Database buttons are powerful because they give everyone the ability to trigger a sequence of actions by simply clicking the button.
Instead of having to manually follow each step, a whole workflow can be condensed into one action.

##########################################

Here are some examples of effective ways to use database buttons.
### Approve a project or document
Project managers can complete all the necessary steps to sign off on a project simply by clicking theApprovebutton.
What youll need for an "Approve" button
Click to expand
Then, customize your button with these steps:
- SelectEdit pages in, and chooseThis page. In theEdit a propertydropdown, change theStatustoDone.
- ClickEdit another propertyand fill out the Completed date with Now (this will always show the date the button was clicked)
- ClickEdit another property, chooseApproved byand selectPerson who clicked the button.
A similar process could be used to approve documents or wiki pages once all edits have been finalized.

##########################################

Or, if a document needs approval from a specific team, such as legal, you can create a button that tags someone from the legal team, marks legal status asPending, and sets an approval deadline for a week from today.
### Escalate a task
Sometimes, a task or engineering issue requires intervention from a manager to get resolved.
Create anEscalatebutton in your database to allow team members to escalate tasks in one click.
Properties for an "Escalate" button
Click to expand
To create theEscalatebutton:
- Update theOwnerproperty to tag your team leader.
- Change the priority status toHigh
- Add a confirmation dialog to continue or cancel.

##########################################

### Upvoting items
An upvote database allows team members to vote on different options in a database, such as topics to discuss at the next all-hands, or new feature suggestions.
What youll need for an "Upvote" button
Click to expand
To edit your Upvote button, simplyEdit the current pageto tag thePerson who clicked the buttonin theUpvoted bycolumn, and the formula will calculate the total number of upvotes.
Upvoting can also be used in your personal Notion space to share ideas and get feedback from friends or family.

##########################################

Other ways to use database buttons:
- Simplify expense tracking Use buttons to categorize expenses or assign budgets. For example, the button could tag a specific budget from your budgets database and be marked asAssigned.
- Keep a habit log Record your habits in a database and track your achievements and streaks over time. YourCompletebutton could tick theDonecheckbox for all columns.
- Tag content in a wiki Tag and categorize wiki pages for quick retrieval. Using a button, you can add a category to your page and mark it asVerified.
- Mark items as duplicate Allow team members to easily flag duplicate items they discover in a database. TheMark as duplicatebutton might add aDuplicatetag and change the status toArchived.

##########################################

## When to use other types of Notion automations
There are three different ways to use automation across your Notion workspace.
### Database buttons
Database buttons allow you to add items to databases and edit several properties simultaneously. Teams can use button properties for smoother project management workflow and to save time on administrative manual work.
You can also create Button blocks on individual pages, and database automations for different sorts of work.
### Button blocks
Add a button to any Notion page by opening the / menu and selectingButton.

##########################################

Buttons live on pages and can create blocks on the current page. They can also edit some properties of database pages or add new pages to a database, making them useful for editing items without needing to navigate to the database itself.
Use button blocks to:
- Generate pages in databases, such as task-creation workflows.
- Edit all items in a database, for example, to assign overdue tasks to you.
- Instantly generate checklists or outlines for meetings or project briefs.
All about buttons
Click to expand
### Database automations
Database automations are for actions taking place behind the scenes.
Unlike buttons, they dont require any clicking. They share some functionality with database buttons, but property updates trigger the actions.

##########################################

Database automations also allow you to send slack messages.Actions can include adding or editing pages in a database, and sending Slack notifications to team members or channels.
Use database automations to:
- Assign a task to someone automatically when the task status changes.
- Send a Slack notification when a new page is added.
- Edit a page property in another database when a property is changed.
If you want to stop a database automation, it has to be paused or deleted.

# Manage client work in a flexible project tracker
## One place for managing work
When you work with lots of different clients, you often end up with information scattered across tools. Conversations happen in Slack or email, clients share Google Docs or PDFs, and you track projects in a chaotic spreadsheet.
When crucial information is spread across tools, team members waste time searching for information, and project managers have to piece together updates from different sources.
Notion acts as a single hub for all your work. You can build a simple project management system and connect everything: briefs, meeting notes, client feedback, documents, and much more.

##########################################

## Flexible, customizable project trackers
In Notion, you can manage the entire customer lifecycle, from prospecting with sales to engaging in project work.
Just create your project tracker database and customize it according to how you operate.
### Visualize your projects in helpful ways
Notion allows you to view your data in many different ways. When you create a database, youll be able to choose from seven different layout options:Board,Calendar,Timeline,Gallery,Table,List, orChart.
But, you arent limited to a single database layout. You can change the layout at any time, or keep several saved views with different layouts and switch between them.

##########################################

Some helpful layouts for project management:
- Client-facing deadline calendar Keep clients on the same page about deadlines and deliverables with a sharedCalendarlayout. Instead of emailing back and forth for status updates, clients have full visibility and can leave feedback as needed.
- Internal tasks on a Kanban board Your internal task tracker could be a Kanban board where tasks are organized by status (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Review, Completed), making it easy for your team to track progress and update task statuses with a simple drag-and-drop.
- PR Campaigns over time Track outreach, media pitches, and campaigns in a Timeline view with clear start and end dates to see how different projects overlap.

##########################################

- Content calendar for clients Use aBoardview grouped by content type to organize blog posts, newsletters, and social media posts by publish date. Share with your clients so they can review drafts and provide approvals.
- A table of all your projects In aTable, categorize all projects by status, priority, and deadlines, giving your team an at-a-glance summary of all ongoing work and upcoming deliverables.
Notion databases are living records of all the work happening at your company.
Instead of a static spreadsheet, you can organize the information in a database according to what you want to see.
To do this, you need to adddatabase propertieslabels you use to categorize entries by status, date, person, etc.

##########################################

Then, you can sort, group, filter and resurface information in countless useful ways.
For example:
- Updating status by drag and drop On a Kanban board, you can group the items by theirStatus(Up Next, In Progress, To Review, etc). Not only does this show you where all work stands, it also makes it easy to update project status with drag and drop.

##########################################

- Group projects by assignee UsePersonproperties to assign team members to a project. In aBoardorTable, you can group projects by Assignee, giving you an understanding of whats on everyones plate, at a glance.
- Rank projects by priority or deadlineSortallows you to change the order in which projects appear. So, you can rank projects from high to low priority, or by order of deadline to see most urgent projects first.
- Organize projects by type Using theSelectproperty, you can give your projects different categories according to the type of work involved. Then, you can group the database by type to see what everyone is working on.

##########################################

You can create several different saved views of your project tracker, each with unique settings, and then tab through them to see your information in different ways.
### Standardize your processes
Notion helps you organize and standardize your work through templates, so you can establish consistent approaches across departments and get projects off the ground faster.
In your project tracker, create database templates for different types of work you do often. Customize those templates so that when you create a new entry from a template, some properties are already filled out and there is an outline ready on the page.

##########################################

You could create templates for:
- Structured campaign briefs A brief outline including objectives, key messaging, deliverables, and timelines.
- Drafting social posts A format for drafting captions, visuals, hashtags, and checklists for social media content.
- Consulting project proposal A standard document for scoping out client projects, detailing objectives, deliverables, and pricing.
- Workshop and training outline Plan training sessions, learning objectives, modules, and exercises.
- Brand guideline details Typography, color palette, logos, and brand voice for client branding projects.
All database pages are fully customizable, so you can get to work on your project directly in the page itself.

##########################################

Anytime you need to scope a new project, do this directly from the project tracker by creating a new entry from a template.
You can have any number of templates saved in your project database: a scope of work for a consulting project, concept for brand development, a marketing strategy, or product launch campaign.
### Work lives in your project tracker
In Notion, work and project management are intertwined.
While some project trackers simply link out to other tools, Notion consolidates all your work in the project page of your database.
This saves everyone the hassle of searching for information, and with everything stored in the project page, nobody has to wonder where relevant documents can be found.

##########################################

In addition to setting up templates for types of projects you do often, you can incorporate diverse elements on page using Notions many different types of blocks.

##########################################

You can:
- Arrange text with headers, columns, bullets, checklists Drag and drop blocks of text into columns, use headers to separate different sections, and add bullets or checklists to organize your ideas and list action items and tasks.
- Insert images, videos, and files on a page You can insert images, videos, or files directly into a Notion page. This creates transparency and allows your team members to easily access reference materials from a project page.
- Embed files from other tools Notion has a variety of embed options. Embed Slack messages, Figma files, Google docs, Loom videos, Miro boards, and more directly onto your Notion page where everyone can access them.
- Create databases inside a page Nest a database inside a page by choosing theInline databaseblock. You might use a database to store meeting notes about a project or reference materials from your client.
- Customize pages with icons, emojis, and a cover image Make pages more memorable and easy for team members to find what they need.

##########################################

Pages are visually appealing by default, so you dont have to spend much time formatting them to share with your team.
Use AI to draft project docs
You can draft anything from a content strategy, to a design brief, or campaign outline in minutes with the help of Notion AI. Learn more aboutNotion AI.
### Tailored project management for clients
Each client you work with has different requirements, guidelines and processes.
Notion will help you collaborate more effectively with clients and make sure you have all relevant information at hand.
When it comes to tracking projects, you could have one central tracker for all your projects, tag each project with the relevant client, and then create client-specific views.

##########################################

Alternatively, give each client their own project or task tracker and share this with them in the client portal. This approach allows you to tailor the tracker according to each clients requirements and processes.
## Go beyond project tracking with end-to-end workflows in Notion
Notion can be your hub for managing entire client workflows.
Connect all the moving parts of your work, automate repetitive actions and visualize information in different ways.

##########################################

Heres how an advertising agency (or any professional services team) might scale their project management system in Notion:
- Collect client requests with Forms Instead of managing messy email chains, useFormsto intake campaign briefs, creative requests, or client feedback directly into your project tracker, so nothing gets lost.

##########################################

- Automate workflows Use database automations to ping team members when project statuses change, or assign a new task owner when a projects status changes.
- Get a clear view of data with a dashboard Build real-time dashboards using theChart database layoutto track campaign milestones, ad performance, team workloads, or project timelines, giving team members and clients instant clarity.
- Connect work for an integrated system Link client projects to meeting notes and documents with aRelationproperty, ensuring everyone always has full context and easy access to relevant information.
- Work more efficiently with AI Notion AI can help you draft project briefs, summarize client meetings, and pull insights from past campaigns so your team can focus on creative strategy.
- Create a wiki where team members can find information A wiki or company home page lets you arrange all the information your team members need daily in an easy-to-navigate format.

##########################################

- Track company or client goals and milestones You can manage milestones and KPIs in Notion to help your team stay on track and see how their work fits in with larger goals and client results.

# Use link previews to collaborate, manage projects, and ship faster
Different teams use different tools to get work done. But what happens when its time to collaborate?
Feedback lives here. Task statuses live there. Soon, it feels like youre panning for gold, sifting for that nugget of information you need to get context, push a project forward, or make a decision.
People already bring information from other tools into Notion simply by sharing links. But with the newest addition to our line of API features link previews you can get live updates from those other tools right in Notion. This enables you to build workflows leveraging the up-to-date information teams need for cross-functional collaboration.

##########################################

Here are a few ways to use link previews to bring full transparency to manage work between teams.
## Get clarity on the work happening in other tools
All you have to do is paste a link from Jira, Slack, Asana, Trello, and GitHub, and a preview is generated with real-time information fetched directly from the link. Heres what it means for you:
- Log in once if a Notion page is shared with you, link previews let you view information from other tools after that initial log-in.
- Display updated information from other tools the links are updated on a continuous basis, so theres no additional work you need to do to update the information.

##########################################

- Build a granular project management system unite all aspects of your project into a single project management system, so youre not chasing around disparate pieces of valuable information. Say, adding tasks from Jira to your project tracking page in Notion so everyone can see the status of tasks in one place. Or adding Slack updates into that same page so you have asingle source of truth.
- Bring teams working on other tools on one page, literally link previews doesnt just gathers tasks, notes, and updates from other tools. It also brings teams together on a single Notion page, where they can paste external links, share information and collaborate without switching tools during an ongoing project.

##########################################

## Build your workflows around people, not tools
When you'reworking cross-functionally, both tools and people come together. But often, there isnt a place to collaborate, meaning information gets lost. Notions API helps you build custom workflows that match project needs, but thats even more powerful with link previews  the information teams need to execute lives in one place, even when folks are using different tools.
Here are a few ways you can use link previews to help your team execute.
### Everyone  not just engineers  knows the status of bug fixes
We know that many engineering teams use tools like Jira and Asana to manage their product roadmap, track bugs, see their backlog, create reports, and more.

##########################################

But other teams outside engineering often dont have insight into these statuses. Instead, theyre left to send Slack messages or emails, asking engineers if the work is complete.If youre using a page in Notion to track the status of bug fixes and product updates for a project , ask your engineering team to post Jira link previews inside the page so other teams know exactly when issues are fixed.
This makes information more accessible to all, helping align teams without meetings, pings, or rooting around.
For example, your marketing team can release a tweet that a critical bug has been fixed without needing to ask engineers its status. Or the sales team can let prospects know about new features as soon as they land.

##########################################

### Build faster knowing the status of product features
A team launching a new product needs to be able to track all the dependencies that go into that final product. For example, you need to build a feature for creating events before your calendaring app is launch-ready.
Its important to be able to navigate constant change against a tight timeline.
Using Notions link previews, product teams can get everyone up to speed without needing to go into tools like GitHub. Simply paste GitHub links inside Notion pages where engineers are tracking feature statuses. That way, new tasks can be started as soon as dependencies are completed, helping your team move quicker.

##########################################

### Connect the dots to centralize information
Swirling conversations about work can be difficult to keep track of, especially when that information lives in different tools.
Using link previews, you can paste a Slack message right into a Notion page  so you have direct access to information (minus the noise) while still in focus mode. For example, when your content team is writing a new blog post, they can get access to relevant Slack messages about that post without being distracted by all the other messages flying around your channels.
### Alignment with external collaborators
Working with external collaborators can bring a few speed bumps to your process. How many times have you shared a doc without giving the right person access?

##########################################

Link previews gives external collaborators all the information they need to execute, uniting teams without needing to manage more access controls.
If youre working with external teams, theyre probably not all using the same project management software. So instead of granting access to entire tools or systems, simply paste links from other tools like Trello and Asana right in Notion so everyones aligned on statuses and action items.
## Manage your projects with ease
Notion helps you bring tools, teams, and workflows into a single source of truth.

##########################################

Normally, updates would be buried under these tools  but link previews ensures you have live information (and full clarity) to execute. Link previews are now supported for Jira, Slack, Asana, Trello, and GitHub.
If youre looking for project management inspiration, here's your guide to build your very ownproject management starter kit.

##########################################

# How managers get a clear view of what everyones working on in Notion
Managers' plates often look like theyre at a buffet  extremely full. Instead of food, it's many types of work, the people executing it, and balancing all the timelines to keep everything moving. This is even more difficult when teams use different tools to do their jobs.
Most project management apps just point to the work, meaning youre always switching between different tabs and tools. But in Notion, you can unite project management with the work itself, along with the people and communication to get that work done.

##########################################

Well show you how to set up a system so you and your team can spend less time going back and forth to find information, and more time getting down to important work. Youll have total visibility into whats going on, what stage projects are at, and each team members current workload.
## Managing work
In the first section of this guide, well look at some of the different ways you can use Notion to coordinate your teams work.
### Company-wide and team-specific wikis
Time is everyones most valuable resource, so set your team up to use it wisely. Make information easily accessible, so teammates arent listlessly digging around outdated documentation or disrupting the flow state of a colleague to ask where something is.

##########################################

Create a top-level homepage, orcompany wiki, where all employees can access shared information like the benefits policy, the mission, vision and values, and company goals. With things likeheaders, columns, and more, you can make information quickly accessible at a glance.
Then, each department or team should have its own, top-level homepage in the sidebar.
Team hubs are important for finding and using info  further cementing this self-service mentality where team members can find what they need without always having to ask their manager. Plus, it enables teams to customize their homepages based on their specific needs.
Inside the teams homepage will live important sub-pages, like one for team structure, or a database of all projects.

##########################################

As a manager, this foundation is built to grow with your team. As you build out processes or add new tools, this information can be neatly organized in the team's wiki, neatly blending flexibility with structure.
### Company-wide databases for work
You can store all kinds of complex, diverse information inside databases. When certain information is accessible by your entire team, work becomes centralized, leading to less confusion.
Create three company-wide databases for your roadmap, documents, and meeting notes.
Your company-wide roadmap should be shared by all teammates, so they can see what's planned (and plan for it). Use a board database here, which is ideal for project management.

##########################################

To categorize the entries in this database, useproperties. These can be customized based on the work at hand.
Here are a few that will be useful:
- Deadline add aDateproperty and rename it "Deadline"to ensure that everyone knows when work must be completed by.
- Project owner aPersonproperty allows you to tag others in the workspace by typing@followed by their name. You can call this "Project owner" to tag the person who is responsible for the project.
- Status you can assign statuses to projects by using aSelectproperty and creating different labels, such as "In progress," "For review," and "Done."

##########################################

Every entry in your roadmap opens up as a page. So all project work is collected in one place, enabling cross-functional teamwork because everyone knows where to get project-specific information.
By organizing work in a board, managers get a high-level glance at all the work their teams are executing.
You can create different views in your database which allows you to see the same information in different ways. To create an alternative database view, go to theViewsdropdown on the left. ClickAdd a view, select the type of database you want, rename it, and clickCreate.

##########################################

You can customize this further, and here are some views that might be useful for your roadmap:
- Board by status a board view allows you to group all entries by status, so you can see project statuses, and easily drag and drop projects across from one stage to the next. To group your board by status, go toGroup byand selectStatus.
- Board by person grouping your projects by the person responsible will allow you to quickly see each team member's workload. In theGroup bydropdown, selectProject owner. Each person will have their own column in the board, and their project cards will appear underneath.
- Calendar a calendar view lets you see all projects by their deadlines, as items will appear on the date they are due.
- Timeline a timeline organizes your projects chronologically, letting you view the timespan of every project. For timeline view to work well, you'll need two date properties, for the start and end date of each project.

##########################################

Youll also need a place to store documentation.
A documents database gives your team a place to go to find any documents they might need to help them get work done, from updated processes to design specs.

##########################################

Your docs database could be a table or list database, and the following properties will come in handy:
- Last edited time this lets you see the most recent updates to a document so you can track progress.
- Type of doc add aSelectproperty and create tags for different types of documents you create (technical spec, architecture overview, etc.).
- Status to assign status to your documents, use anotherSelectproperty. You can then tag documents asIn progress,For review, etc.
- Reviewers with aPersonproperty, tag anyone who needs to review the document.
- Priority assign a priority level with aSelectproperty. This will come in handy later if you want to arrange your docs in order of priority.

##########################################

Some different views you could use for your documents database:
- Whats current a filtered view showing documents tagged In progress or that relate to an ongoing project.
- Document type create views for different types of docs, such as a view for all your project proposals or research documents.
- By person you can have views for each of your team members so that they can see any documents where they are tagged.
With a shared meeting notes databases, even employees in different time zones can provide async updates and review action items  they're part of these meetings, even if they weren't there physically.

##########################################

Some useful properties for a meeting notes database:
- Created time use theCreated timeproperty so you can see when a meeting took place and organize your list with the most recent at the top.
- Type of meeting add aSelectproperty and create tags for different types of meetings, like weekly sync or all-hands.
- Meeting participants aPersonproperty will let you tag all the people who attended the meeting.
Just like with your projects and docs, you can create views based on your database properties. For example, you can create a view of your meetings database that's filtered to show only meetings that took place this week. After you've added a new view, you can click onFilter, and choose whereMeeting date,is within,The past week.

##########################################

## Managing people
The other aspect of a managers job is supervising the people that make up your team. Here are some tools you can use to manage the people on your team.
### Share a page with all your direct reports
Create a shared page between you and all your direct reports for 1:1 meetings, which will give you both a place to take notes and prepare. This can be a full-page database.
To streamline these meetings, you can create a template that prompts each attendee to provide updates or feedback. That way, you give the meeting some structure. And when you learn a better way to conduct these meetings? Just update the template.

##########################################

As part of the template, you can even include that teammate's quarterly goals. If you have adatabase with your team's goals, link a view of that database at the top of your meeting notes to have a weekly review of their progress.
To create a linked database, use the/command and selectCreate linked database. From the dropdown, choose the database you want to link to. In this case, it'd be a database where you enter all your team's goals. Then, apply a filter so that this database only displays goals assigned to this particular team member.
### Upvotes
An upvote database gives team members a chance to voice their opinions and allows you to take your teams considerations into account.

##########################################

You can use this database to collect feedback and suggestions before Q&A sessions and all-hands meetings or let team members vote on which product feature should be up next for development.
We have a full guide to creating and using anupvote database, which helps managers ensure their team members feel included in company decision-making.
## Templates to cement your processes
By setting up database templates, you'll make sure that everyone is reading from the same script, and starting every project, meeting, or document with the same criteria. Theyre especially helpful for recurring projects or meetings.
To make a database template, click the arrow next toNewon the database, and click+ New template.

##########################################

You can create templates for work that's often repeated. For example, in your projects database, you could have a template for the types of projects your team often works on (like a design spec or a bug report), and in the meetings database, create templates for meetings that happen regularly (like a weekly sync or post-mortem).

In your docs database, you could create a template for RFC.
This stands for "Request for Comment, and its a document that invites teams to join a discussion  a great way for managers to get their team's feedback about a particular idea.

##########################################

You can fill out your templates with information that will help teams get started quickly on the work, including headers and bullet points, questions, and checklists for action items. They'll help your team follow follow processes and reduce repetitive work.
## Connecting your work with the bigger picture
Now that you have systems for managing both work and people, Notion helps managers link this work together, so they have a full line of sight into projects and the people behind them.
### Relational databases
Notion gives you the ability to link databases, which can connect big projects with the smaller tasks it takes to complete them.

##########################################

For example, by connecting your projects database with your meeting notes, youll be able to link meetings to the projects they relate to. When you open up the project youll have access to all the meeting notes that correspond to it.
To find out more about linking databases, have a look at our guide to usingrelation and rollup properties.
### Goal setting
Its easy for team members to get lost in the day-to-day and lose sight of how their work fits into the larger team and company goals.
Weve devised agoal-setting systemthat keeps goals top of mind, encourages taking action towards them and ensures that everyone can see the context behind the work theyre doing.

##########################################

## Best practices for collaboration and communication
It's easy for everyone to share information and work together in Notion, both within your team and with other departments across your organization.

##########################################

Here's how we think about the best ways to work with other teammates:
- Use person properties whether it's the person who's leading the meeting or the one responsible for completing a project, using a person property creates a clear owner of the work at hand. It's also the person anyone with questions about the work should come to.
- Where to use comments there's a lot more to say about , but here's how you can use them effectively. For anything in-line and specific, comment and tag teammates in the body of a page. For high-level updates, use page comments (at the top of a page) to communicate that something is ready for review or you've completed feedback.
- Set up permission groups these make sharing work across departments a breeze. You can for each team at your company. Then when work is ready to share with the engineering or marketing team, all you have to do is share with that group, instead of going through and sharing with individual members of those teams.

# Mastering the RACI model for effective project management
- Notion is a sleek place from which you can confidently run any project, and is ideal for building a RACI matrix.
- RACI is a project management method used to assign roles for each task.R is for Responsible (who does the task), A is for Accountable (who approves the task), C is for Consulted (who needs to give input), and I is for Informed (who needs to know about the task completion).
* R is for Responsible (who does the task), A is for Accountable (who approves the task), C is for Consulted (who needs to give input), and I is for Informed (who needs to know about the task completion).
- Add each of these roles as properties in your Notion database.
- Include multiple views to your RACI database, such as one that only shows tasks connected toMe.Mewill reflect whoever is signed into Notion at the time.
- Database entries in Notion are pages themselves, where you can store all the information regarding a task.For more repetitive tasks, try creating a template button, and configure the content you want to replicate.You can connect a task page to a Slack channel, so that any updates to the doc will be relayed there.
* For more repetitive tasks, try creating a template button, and configure the content you want to replicate.
* You can connect a task page to a Slack channel, so that any updates to the doc will be relayed there.
- Keeping work within the task pages of your Notion database is helpful: the more time people spend there, the more familiar they will be with everyone's roles and their own.

# Migrate from Confluence to Notion and transform your wiki into a connected workspace
In your existing team wiki, information may be difficult to access, and creating new wiki content is a frustrating process. Maybe your docs are gathering dust, and you have no idea whether team members are using that information in their daily work.

##########################################

What if you could breathe new life into all the information youve amassed, and build a library of accurate information where employees can quickly find what they need? In Notion, you can grow your knowledge base and build powerful connections between documentation and daily work, which live side by side. Instead of hopping from tool to tool, you can organize information, manage projects and tasks, take notes, and more, all in one place.
Migrating your Confluence wiki might seem like a daunting task, but it only takes a few steps with our importer. In this guide, youll learn how to transform your static docs into a connected workspace, where information helps your teams stay aligned and productive.

##########################################

## A functional wiki empowers your team
Your team wiki is home to everything from your company mission statement and goals to standard operating procedures, onboarding documents, training materials, and more.
But it doesnt have to be just a place of reference. With Notion, you have the flexibility to connect the dots between documentation and daily work, meaning teams always have the necessary context behind what they do.
In your Notion wiki, you can:
- Build pages and edit information easily For non-technical teams, creating pages in Confluence can be intimidating and time-consuming. Notions user-friendly interface makes contributing to the wiki more accessible for everyone.

##########################################

- Connect all your work seamlessly Instead of linking out to other tools, Notion puts both documentation and work in the same place. This means wiki documents can live next to project specs, and just a click away from the product roadmap.
- Create custom workflows Software shouldn't dictate the way you work, your team should. Notion is malleable enough to fit any process (even workflows custom to only your team), whether its a project-specific Kanban board or customizable templates used for recurring projects.

##########################################

When a wiki functions as both a home to information and a place to get work done every day, it becomes the singular hub for just about anything your employees need. Everyone can go faster, with more information, and more connection to one another.
## How to import your Confluence wiki into Notion
You can migrate your Confluence wiki to Notion either by using the API importer or importing a zip file.
Use the API importer if:
- Youre importing an entire Confluence space over to Notion
- You want to migrate users and/or comments
- Your Confluence space is less than 15GB in size

##########################################

Opt for the file importer if:
- You only want to import certain pages within your Confluence space
- You dont need to migrate users and/or comments.
- Your selected pages to import are less than 5GB
Next, well explain both methods.
### Migrate your entire Confluence space with the API importer
The API importer is the best way to migrate your entire space into Notion. Youll keep all your comments, and Confluence users will be mapped to existing Notion users via email or username. If no user exists in Notion, placeholders will be created until the users sign up.

## Tips for building a wiki where work and documentation are intertwined
In Notion you can create documents, databases and bring content from external tools so all your companys information lives in a single place.
Here are some examples of how to customize your wiki in Notion:
- Turn your knowledge into a wiki Add powerful features to your knowledge base byturning it into a wiki, where you can tag pages with properties, verify documents and view your content in versatile database layouts. Go to the options menuand selectTurn to Wiki.

##########################################

- Verify pages to signal that content is up to date Withpage verification, you can verify content until a certain date (or indefinitely). Team members will trust the information in wiki pages, and you can ensure everything stays up to date and accurate.

##########################################

- Keep your projects and docs polished with templates You can endlessly customize your teams workspace in Notion, but theres no need to start from scratch. Usedatabase  templatesto kickoff projects and create documents, and customize them as you go.
- Create top-level pages and nestle sub-pages within In your wiki homepage, create pages for all the topics and sub-pages inside them. After youve usedTurn to Wiki,  your wiki will have database features, meaning you can search for information and useviews, filters and sortsto find what you need, fast.
- Structure your wiki in an easy-to-navigate layout You can drag and drop pages into columns, create headers and dividers to lay all your information out clearly. Add flair to your wiki page with emojis, icons, images and page covers - this also makes it clearer to navigate

##########################################

- Ask Notion AI to help you create wiki content Hit the spacebar to call upNotion AI this built-in AI assistant will help you quickly draft any kind of wiki content, or edit and improve what youve written.
- Collaborate seamlessly with commenting and tagsYou can comment on any wiki page, either in the comment section at the top or on specific content throughout the page. Tag people using the @ key so you know they will see it. You can also mention and link to any workspace page. Learn more aboutcollaborating in Notion.
- Give everyone the right access to wiki contentUsesharing and permissionsettings to make sure everyone has the right level of access to content. You can grant full access to some team members, while others will only be able to view or comment on certain pages.
- Sync content from other parts of the workspace Copy and paste content from anywhere in the workspace and then turn this into asynced block, so it will update everywhere anytime changes are made.
- Use connecting databases to manage projects, tasks, notes and docs You can create databases forprojects, tasks,notes, and docs. Then connect all these with a relation property to build links between all aspects of your work.

##########################################

## Ways to recreate other Confluence functionality in Notion
Youll be able to recreate most of the Confluence features in Notion with different block types.

##########################################

For example:
- List action items in a to-do list If you need to tick off action items, create aTo-do listblock.
- Expand and collapse content inside toggle headingsIn place of Confluences Expand feature, you can useToggleandToggle headingsin Notion.
- Use callouts instead of panelsConfluence has Panels for different types of content, like Info, Decision, Note, Success, Error, and Warning. In Notion, create aCalloutand customize it however you want.
- Organize information in tables or databasesYou can create Tables and Tables with Images in Confluence. In Notion, you can insert aSimple tableinto a page or organize information in more advanced databases.
- Add bullets and checklists to simple tables To replace bullets and checklists in tables, you can use emojis, hyphens or brackets.
- Embed images into pagesWhile Notion doesnt yet have integrations with Gliffy andDraw.io, you can embed content from those apps inImageformat.

# Migrating to Notion for Project Management
Project managementin Notion is a powerful solution that easily connects projects to documents, notes, and wikis to keep everything in one place. While many tools are standalone and require specific workflows, Notion gives you the flexibility to customize projects to your exact needs.
In this guide, well discuss how project management in Notion works, some of its key features, and best practices for keeping the most productive and connected workspace possible.

##########################################

## Understand how Notion Projects work
Out of the box, project management in Notion comes with two primary areas that are connected to one another:ProjectsandTasks. Both of these are pre-configured, specialized databases, giving you the powerful ability to link your projects and tasks to pages in Notion.
This system, like everything else you do in Notion, can also be customized to fit the needs of your team. Whether thats creating a filtered view based on a specific property or adding in tags to help your team stay organized, Notion Projects gives you the flexibility to work with more speed and clarity.
Before you get started managing your projects in Notion, lets go through a few of the fundamental features that project management is built on.

##########################################

- No-code building blocks Notion gives users more control over their workspace with lots of customization. Each page in Notion can be built using a variety of blocks (like text, to-do lists, images, code snippets, embeds, and more) to create a workspace that truly reflects your team's workflow.
- Databases Databases are a core feature in Notion that help you manage and organize your pages. Databases can be used for anything  a collection of meeting notes, your core database of projects and tasks, a document storage system, and so much more. Information in your databases can be viewed in multiple ways, from a list to a calendar to kanban board.
- Document collaboration Not only can you collaborate on tasks, but you can also work together on documents and notes. Its great for brainstorming, meeting minutes, proposals and briefs, and collaborative writing.
- Nested pages Notion allows you to create a page within a page (called a sub-page), which can help organize complex projects and keep related content together.
- Templates Notion has a variety of templatesfor different uses  from project management to meeting agendas, team wikis, and CRMs. Using these templates makes getting setup and up-to-speed easier than ever.

##########################################

## Prepare your team for migration
### Identify champions within your organization
We recommend identifying a few representatives from your team to manage the setup and migration process before inviting the rest of your organization into your Notion workspace.
If you need help troubleshooting any issues, please contact Notion support. Need additional support throughout the migration process? You can work with a Notion Certified Consultant by visitingnotion.so/consultants.
### Plan for change management
Migrating from one tool to another can be a big initiative. To ease the change management process, prepare some internal communication, resources, and escalation paths within your organization to make the transition as easy as possible.
Email templates

##########################################

Communicating this change within your organization can be a challenge. To help communicate the transition from your previous tool into Notion, we created a few email templates to use.

- Welcome to Notion
- Write and edit text
- Using your sidebar
- Sharing pages and information
- Getting started with databases
- Using database views
- Creating linked databases
- Organized workspace best practices
### Translate project management terminology to Notion
Before diving into the functionality you get with project management in Notion, its important to define how the features you use now translate in Notion. Below, well go through the hierarchies of a few common project management tools and see how their terms align with Notion:
Jira
Asana
Linear
Monday
Moving terms into Notion
You can rename any field in a Notion database. Prefer the term epic? You can rename projects to epics to minimize confusion.
## Set up your Notion workspace

##########################################

### Configure your admin settings
Your Notion workspace has plenty of flexibility when it comes to admin, security, provisioning, and more. As a workspace owner or admin, its important to keep Notion clean, productive, and secure by turning on and off specific settings to fit your needs.
A few general best practices include:
- Check your admin settings to ensure the right people are able to change settings and add users
- Updating permissions for teamspaces so everyone in your workspace can edit as needed
- Verify your workspace security settings to make sure your guest and sharing restrictions are set
- Check your connections to make sure all integrations are properly configured
To learn how you can get set up in Notion,read our guide here.

##########################################

### Decide on a migration strategy
To fully setup your Notion workspace in a way that works best for your organization, we recommend having a strategy in place to manage all your information through the migration. Below, we cover how you can decide what migration strategy fits your needs, and how you can optimally organize your workspace.
What to migrate to Notion
As with any migration, there are pros and cons to each approach. Its important to understand exactly how your team or company plan on working and what makes the most sense for your workflows.

##########################################

- Start fresh Starting with a clean slate means that you and your team can fully customize your Notion experience to your needs, and take advantage of Notions flexibility and connectivity. However, it may require you archive your old tool to retain data for audit and regulatory purposes, or create a custom import if users need access.
- Migrate all data This option maintains a record of your past information all in Notion without the need to keep your previous tool. Depending on the amount of data youre moving over, however, it may clutter your workspace and overwhelm your processes. This option will likely require additional help from an internal or external IT team to ease the process.
- Cut-off date Only migrating data after a specific date reduces the amount of information migrated and makes it easy to know exactly what will be pulled into Notion. Like the previous strategies, this will likely require you archive your old tool for audit and regulatory purposes.
- Migrate active projects only Moving projects that are actively in flight is a good way to reduce clutter and technical debt without overwhelming amounts of data. This option still allows you to customize your new workflows in Notion while maintaining current information. However, it may require you archive your old tool to retain data for audit and regulatory purposes, or create a custom import if users need access.

##########################################

Theres no single strategy that fits every company, so its important to work with your team and cross-functional partners to figure out which will best suit your needs.For most teams, we suggest either migrating projects after a certain date or moving active projects only to minimize clutter in your workspace.
Creating new workflows
Many customers use this as a chance to redefine workflows and build more streamlined project management processes.
How to organize your workspace
Its important to decide how you want to organize information within your workspace. Within your company workspace, you can create dedicatedteamspacesfor every team that can be customized to fit their needs.

##########################################

For smaller teams, we recommend using one general teamspace with databases for tasks, projects, docs, and meetings. Since information within a teamspace is accessible and connected by default, its easy to set up and work in one place.
For larger teams, we recommend creating individual teamspaces for every team (e.g., Marketing, Product & Engineering, Finance, etc.), each with its own wiki, tasks, and projects. This allows teams to work how they need, but they can still connect with others between teamspaces.
## Begin your migration
There are two ways to migrate your project management information into Notion.

##########################################

- If youre migrating from Asana, please use our importer tool.Refer to our Asana migration guide for more information on how to get started.
- If youre migrating from any other project management tool, you will need to move your information manually.
### Manual migration into Projects & Tasks
To start migrating projects into Notion, simply add theProjects& taskstemplate. Selecting this will add both a Projects database and a Tasks database to your teamspace. If you manage projects through sprints or require issue tracking, you can use theProjects, Tasks, & Sprintstemplate to get additional functionality.
Using projects and teamspaces

##########################################

We recommend you have one projects database per teamspace so teams can each have their own sources of truth but quickly connect to the rest of the workspace.
For each of your teamspaces, create projects and tasks that correspond with their counterparts in your legacy tool in these project and task databases. The two databases will already be connected because they arerelated databases.

##########################################

Once you have your projects and tasks added, you can add information associated with each project or task (such as status, assignee, or comments) as properties in the database and customize your project setup. Here are some key features and configurations to consider:
- Add projects & tasks details In addition to the preset properties and views that come with these templates, you canadd custom fieldsandrelated databasesto fit Notion into your existing workflows. To add new property fields, go to your menu in your database, click onProperties, and then click on+ New Property. At the top, youll see suggested properties that may be helpful to your team, such as estimates or a unique ID.
- Views Each database can be displayed in many different visualizations, or what we call views. In addition to table view, the contents of a database can be visualized as a list, board, calendar, gallery, or timeline - whatever makes the information the most useful. To learn more about database views,see the Organize information with Databases course here.
- Issue tracking TheProjects, Tasks, & Sprintstemplate features a unique ID for each task, an integration with GitHub so you can link the relevant PRs to your task, an easy way to view your backlog.
- Sprints TheProjects, Tasks, & Sprintstemplate comes with a set-up that allows you to do task management in time-boxed sprints. It features a Complete sprint button that helps you move tasks between sprints and close out work thats already been completed.
- Automating workflows Create customButtonsto complete multiple steps in one click, like adding a new task, assigning it to a team member and giving it a status. If your team works in sprints, learn about sprint automations here.
- Portfolios, goal-setting and OKRs If you have projects that are bucketed into larger themes (such as portfolios or objectives), you can link them to your projects by creating an additional database to your teamspace that you can use to pull in projects. An easy way to get started is to open the Templates gallery and duplicate the OKR and goal setting templates into your workspace. Create a relation property to the database thats tracking those goals or objectives.Learn more about creating Relations here.

# Notify people instantly  with just a click of a button
Buttons are a powerful way to automate repetitive tasks, like regenerating templates or triggering database actions. But here's something you might not knowyou can also use them to send instant notifications. When you need to quickly notify specific people or teams about urgent matters, skip the back-and-forth by setting up notifications through your preferred channelin-app, Slack, or Gmail. With a single click, your team will be instantly notified when something needs attention.

##########################################

## Set up a button-triggered notification for critical issues
When you're managing critical bugs with your engineering team, sometimes issues come up that need immediate attention outside your usual process. If youre an incident manager, you may want to quickly bring together your on-call team and key stakeholders when critical incidents occur. That's where buttons come in handythey make it super easy to notify your team right away, so everyone can jump in when it matters most.

##########################################

Here's how you can incorporate this simple feature in your workflow:
- Locate the spot where you want to place your button For our example, adding a button at the end of our bug report page may be an effective way to let the reporter decide if the bug needs escalation. Choose where to put your button based on how you'll use it.
- Add some context Add a clear message box that explains what the button does and when people should use it. Write simple instructions that help users know the right time to click the button.
- Create the button Setting up the button is easy! Simply press the forward slash key and type/button.

##########################################

- Trigger an in-app notification to the on-call incident manager First, notify the incident manager on call, or whoever needs to review the issue immediately through an in-app notification. Selectsend notificationto from the list of options. You can select up to 20 specific people and customize your message using formulas.
- Trigger an email to the team leads You can also add an action to Send mail to to notify people by email. For example, you can send an email to your team leads when there's an urgent issue. You can write your own subject line and message for the email. Check outthis guideto learn more about advanced formulas.

##########################################

- Set up a confirmation popup Add a popup message that appears before sending notifications. This helps prevent mistakes by asking users to confirm their action first. ChooseShow confirmationfrom the list of options and write your own message.
- Add a confirmation note Add a message that shows up after clicking the button. Chooseinsert blockand type in what you want people to see after they click.
- Arrange to perfection Make sure to put the confirmation popup at the top of your button actions list. Then review the order of all your other actions to make sure everything is in the right sequence.
Voila! Your notification button is ready to use.

##########################################

## Three powerful ways to enhance your buttons
Buttons really shine when you connect them to multiple actions, creating smooth workflows that do more with less effort. Check outour guide to get started with button automations. In this section, let's look at three ways to make your notification buttons even more helpful:
- Use webhooks in buttonsSay your engineering team uses Zendesk for issue tracking. You can set up a button to create support tickets automatically. One click sends all the details to Zendesk, makes a new ticket, and lets your team knowwithout ever leaving Notion.

##########################################

- Customize your button fields using custom formulasYou can make your notifications smarter by using advanced formulas. To do this, click the formula icon to connect information from other databases to your notifications. For instance, if you keep track of who's on call in a separate on-call triage database, you can automatically send notifications to the right person based on the current schedule.
- Set up multi-step content review workflowsFor example, when a content piece needs review from multiple teams, one click can notify the marketing manager. After their review, the button automatically alerts legal for compliance check, followed by executive sign-off. This creates a streamlined review process with clear status tracking for all stakeholders.

##########################################

And there you have it! With buttons, your team can keep everyone informed without the usual ping-pong of messages. Just one click transforms complex communication chains into a simple notification.

## How to use Notion AI
Notion AI produces text responses based on user's questions and the current page context.
Pull up Notion AI in one of three ways, depending on your needs in that moment.
- To improve existing content,highlight text and select Ask AI. Then, pick an option from the dropdown or write a custom prompt.
- To generate a summary or extract insights from a page,type/AIto view AI blocks, or ask Notion AI to write anything for you.
- To draft new text,use thespacekey on a new page or line and enter any prompt.

##########################################

In this guide well explore some of the many practical ways these three actions can improve your document writing, reading, and editing experience.
How does artificial intelligence produce text?

## Become more efficient
AI is often thought of as a tool to author information based on a prompt. Notion AI can certainly do that, but it really shines as a follow-up to make sense of your mostly completed thoughts.

##########################################

Highlight text andAsk AIto do anything to offload time-consuming tasks that Notion AI can do in seconds: extract action items from meeting notes, distill insights from customer research notes, even generate high-quality translations.
### Meetings made easy
Summarizing messy notes for stakeholders (and your future self) can be a lengthy and tedious process. You know what you talked about, they know what you talked about, but someone still needs to write it down. Or at least they did. Now Notion AI can do it for you.

##########################################

Special AI blocks  summarize, action items, and custom content  use the power of Notion AIplusthe context from the page on which theyre deployed to create perfectly-custom content that you cant generate anywhere else. What's more, they can be baked intodatabase templatesas a regular part of your meeting process.
Three advanced blocks make use of AI features.
- Recap with/summarizecreate an executive overview in seconds. Notion AI will use context from your document to generate a few sentences that summarizes the entire document.
- Pull out action items with/action itemswhether youre analyzing an entire call transcript or hastily taken notes, Notion AI can help you remember what you committed to doing next.

##########################################

- Write anything with/custom AI blockask Notion AI to expand on a thought outlined on the page, or write a counter-argument to your main point. Unlike starting from scratch, this block makes use of whats on the page to inform its output, leading to a more helpful result.
Use AI blocks in database templates
If your meeting routine includes usingdatabase templatesto structure agendas or prompt discussion, consider adding AI blocks to the templates directly to encourage automating follow up tasks as a team.

##########################################

### Spend more time ideating, less time formatting
Sometimes, its easy to get ideas on a page, but can take hours to format those same thoughts into a presentable document to share with your team or the world. With Notion AI, you can quickly move from scrappy notes to polished docs. Heres just a few ways you might try this in your workspace:
- Write bullet points, have AI do the rest job descriptions, performance reviews, and so much more. Write a list of requirements or accomplishments, then ask AI to create a paragraph covering this content or make this sound more professional.

##########################################

- Identify key insights quickly use AI to pinpoint the most important parts of a document and quickly gain insight without extensive reading. Try asking AI to create a list of bullet points with important items or even summarize this information in a table.
- Analyze large text-based data sets no need to sort through hundreds of open-ended survey results to understand group sentiment. With Notion AI you can highlight a large body of text and ask for a bullet point summary of any length. Try asking AI to pull out the most five common themes from this data or to count how many times a specific request was mentioned.
Custom prompts to get you started

##########################################

Not sure what to ask AI? Here's a few things to try:
- Create a list of bullet points with important items
- Summarize this information in a table
- Pull out common themes from this data

## Transform existing content
Stop bouncing between tools and waiting for copy review to move into the next phase of editing when writing a lengthy doc. Notion AI can help you quickly transform existing content into something more suited to the task at hand, without the need for manual reconfiguring. Whether you need to adapt the tone of a document, fix spelling and grammar, find synonyms, or translate content into another language, Notion AI can help.

##########################################

With Notion AI, you can easily move between tasks and produce the right output for any situation. Heres just some of the things you can ask AI to do for you:
- Adapt tone of writing the way you explain a project to peers might not be the right way to phrase something to an executive, even if the content is more or less the same. Take an existing draft or stream of consciousness paragraph, and ask Notion AI to make this more professional, or summarize key points as an overview.
- Translate content into another language if youre working with a global team or global clients, you understand how time-consuming translation can be. Start with some text, submit a request in another app, wait a few days, then paste translated content back where you started. With Notion AI you can generate quick, accurate translations between many languages, right where youre doing the rest of your work.
- Get synonyms and define words whether youre reading a complex doc and need to quickly define words, or writing one and trying to find the right phrase to capture your thoughts, Notion AI can help. Get your thoughts on the page in whatever form they come to you, then simply highlight a selection of text and select an option from the dropdown.

##########################################

## Start from scratch
When youre stuck staring at a blank page, ask Notion AI for ideas  or an entire draft  to get started. Provide a prompt or some initial ideas, and AI can help generate content for you in whatever format you request. Once an output is generated, continue asking Notion AI for revisions until youre happy with the result. Then you can just fine-tune the result.

##########################################

### How to write a great prompt
No matter how or why you are using Notion AI, the best way to get the output you want is to focus on specificity of the prompt. To that end, we asked Notion AI how to write a good prompt (couldnt have said it much better ourselves). Follow these tips when writing your own custom prompts, and keep in mind that you can always respond to Notion AI to refine the output into something you like.

##########################################

- Start with a clear goal in mind. What do you want AI to generate for you?
- Make sure your prompt is specific and focused. This will help AI understand what you're asking for and produce a more accurate output.
- Provide as much context as possible. Include any relevant background information, keywords, or requirements like desired output length or tone.
- Keep it simple. Avoid overly complicated language or jargon.
So, what does that look like in practice? Consider the following prompts, and how they might be improved according to the guidance above.

##########################################

- Instead of write an instagram caption about interior design, ask it to write an instagram caption about modern light fixtures. Keep the tone friendly, and the overall length under 300 characters. Include 3-5 relevant hashtags
- Instead of brainstorm product features for a software app, try including specific goals your team is trying to accomplish, and a description of what your software app does.
## AI summary
While we can talk about the value of Notion AI all day long, the best proof is seeing it in action. So, we asked it to summarize this guide. Pretty neat, right?

##########################################

The article describes how to use an AI assistant in Notion to help summarize and edit documents. The assistant can generate summaries, extract key points or action items, translate between languages, rewrite sections to change tone, suggest synonyms, and more. Users can highlight text and select "Ask AI" or type "/AI" to get AI suggestions. The assistant uses context from the page and custom user prompts to produce outputs. Examples show how to use the assistant to summarize meetings, polish bullet point lists into paragraphs, and analyze survey data.

# Where does Notion fit into your companys tool ecosystem?
Notion serves as the connective tissue between people and projects  synthesizing all content and context into a single, reliable source of truth.
But what happens when you need a different tool for the job? Notion complements and enhances it.
We recognize that modern organizations rely on a complex ecosystem of tools (88 different tools on average!) that overlap in some way, shape, or form with Notion. These tools help teams communicate, document, and track work. Ultimately, these tools help us all work better together  one of Notions strengths.

##########################################

Notion enhances, rather than replaces, your tool ecosystem. As long as you set clear internal guidelines for where work should happen and leave room for overlap, Notion can help you:
- Stay focused when toggling between many different tools.
- Reduce context switching by integrating everything you need in one place.

Keeping everything in Notion means the team only has to learn one tool, instead of bouncing between different tools with different interfaces. Dmitri Gaskin, Co-Founder, Branch.
Learn aboutBranchs documentation system built in Notion, and use itsengineering roadmap template.

##########################################

## Notion and Slack  two ways to communicate
Since Slack and Notion serve two different channels of communication  Notion for asynchronous collaboration and Slack for real-time discussions  both tools augment one other.
Notion  async collaboration
- Single source of truth that is easy to reference and revisit.
- Document ideas, action items, and plans.
- Long-form writing that cultivates clear thinking and well thought-out ideas.
Slack  real-time discussion
- Instant accessibility to the broader team.
- Ask questions, discuss, and make decisions in real-time.
- Quicker, stream-of-consciousness writing for spontaneous ideation.
These different communication channels complement each other and build synergy
Click to expand

##########################################

Swirling conversations about work can be difficult to keep track of, especially when that information lives in different tools.
Using link previews, you can paste a Slack message right into a Notion page  so you have direct access to information (minus the noise) while still in focus mode. For example, when your content team is writing a new blog post, they can gain access to relevant Slack messages about that post without being distracted by the other messages flying around your channels.

##########################################

## How tools come together in Notion
While Notion and Slack are two different tools that complement each other, you can also bring those tools inside Notion for better collaboration. Instead of needing to jump between tools and waste time context-switching, heres how you can bring information into Notion.
### Embed complementary tools
Easily embed tools that help enrich Notion pages, so you can tell a complete story. You can embed virtually any online content within Notion pages  from video and audio players to Figma and Invision mockups, to entire Google documents and spreadsheets. This includes streaming multimedia, PDFs, forms, and interactive maps.

##########################################

Designers can embed Figma files into Notion for the marketing teams feedback. HR can embed Google Maps into a new hires welcome page in Notion. Product teams can even embed Typeforms to survey users in Notion. This centralizes information and reduces the need to constantly switch tools and tabs when collaborating cross-functionally.
### Integrate collaborative tools
Using our API,link previewshelp turn Notion into the central organizing hub of your tool ecosystem. They embed real-time, synced visualizations of external tools  without having to leave Notion.

##########################################

All you have to do is paste a link from Jira, Slack, Asana, Trello, or GitHub, and a preview is generated with real-time information fetched directly from the link. Link previews gather information from other tools so you can collaborate with cross-functional teams and make quick decisions inside one Notion workspace. This means you can access Jira, GitHub, and Slack from Notion to gain back time lost context switching.
For example, we know that many engineering teams use tools like Jira and Asana to manage their product roadmap, track bugs, see their backlog, create reports, and more.

##########################################

But other teams outside engineering often dont have insight into these statuses. Instead, theyre left to send Slack messages or emails, asking engineers if the work is complete. If youre using a page in Notion to track the status of bug fixes and product updates for a project, ask your engineering team to post Jira link previews inside the page so other teams know exactly when issues are fixed.
This makes information more accessible to all, helping align teams without meetings, pings, or rooting around.

##########################################

This allows teams to:
- Build faster knowing the status of product features when all information lives in Notion, that saves your team time from searching for information or statuses (so they can spend time building).
- Build a granular project management system unite all aspects of your project into a single project management system, so youre not chasing around disparate pieces of valuable information.
- Align with external collaborators link previews gives external collaborators all the information they need to execute. Everyone is aligned on statuses and action items without needing to manage more access controls.

##########################################

## Notion complements and enhances other tools
Understanding how Notion fits into your toolstack helps you get the most out of it.
Notion is great for async communication (and has been referred to as the other half of Slack) because of how you can organize and easily access information in documents. But Notion also pulls together all your other tools too  and when information lives in one place, it saves your team time searching for what they need to execute.
## Consolidation opportunities with Notion
If you use tools for any of the following use-cases, you can consider consolidating them in Notion for a more connected workspace experience.

# Use Notions Data Retention settings to keep your team compliant & restore content
Your company trusts Notion with its most important and confidential information. Thank you.
With the ability to set custom data retention settings in Notion, your team can now easily comply with your companys requirements.
Whether youre an IT professional setting up Notion for the first time, or just a contributor trying to be a good steward of your companys data, its important to understand how different artifacts in Notion translate to your teams specific policies.

##########################################

### Why teams might use custom data retention settings
For the majority of teams on Notion, you shouldnt need to customize your data retention settings. However, there are a few reasons why you might want to consider setting custom retention settings. These include:
- Meeting industry-specific regulatory standards Data retention settings are important for compliance with industry-specific regulations, such as HIPAA for healthcare and GLBA for finance. These regulations often require that certain types of data be kept for a certain period of time, and failure to comply can result in significant legal and financial consequences. By implementing custom data retention settings, companies can ensure that they are meeting these requirements and avoiding any potential legal issues.
- Internal data governance best practices Your company might have specific standards across tools about how data should be retained. These can help reduce the risk of data breaches, reduce storage costs (in some tools), and ensure that data is only kept for as long as it is necessary. Furthermore, retention settings can help companies manage their data in a more structured way, making it easier to find and use the data they need.
- Litigation & Legal Management Data retention is also important for litigation matters because it can help protect the company from legal claims. By retaining data, companies can demonstrate that they have taken reasonable measures to preserve evidence and comply with legal requirements. This can help reduce the risk of sanctions or other penalties for spoliation of evidence.

##########################################

Data retention in Notion
For more information about data retention in Notion, check outour help center article.
## Translating Notion settings to meet your requirements
If you fall into one of the groups above, you will want to consider using custom data retention settings to keep your Notion use compliant. These settings dictate what happens to Notion pages after theyre placed in the trash.

##########################################

If youre not familiar with Notion, check out the following definitions before moving on:
- Pages Notion pages are where all of your content lives. These are roughly analogous to a document in a traditional word processing software. Pages you and your team are working on can be viewed in the sidebar in the left-hand side of your app.
- Sidebar The sidebar, located on the left hand side of the app, is your navigation hub for all things Notion. Its where youorganize, rearrange, and find your pages within your workspace. If pages are like documents, the sidebar is like your file manager.
- Trash This is where deleted pages live until they are retained (more on that later). You can find and sort through pages in the trash on the bottom left hand side of your sidebar.

##########################################

A note on blocks
Blocks arethe way you build in Notion. Everything that sits on a page is a block including text, images, and tables. You can mix and match different blocks to create unique pages and tools for your team.
When blocks are deleted, they exist in page history, which is retained alongside the page itself.
### What happens to deleted pages?
When pages are deleted, they and all of their contents immediately move to the trash. Notions data retention settings dictates what happens to pages and their contentaftertheyre placed here.
There are three locations a document can be in after it is moved to the trash, and your data retention settings allow you to dictate how long pages stay in each of these locations.

##########################################

- Pages in trash To start, pages that have been deleted will be stored in trash. As an Enterprise workspace owner, you have the ability to customize how long pages will stay in trash before they are deleted. The default is 30 days, but workspace owners can set this to be up to 10 years.
- Retained pages (Deleted from trash) After pages are deleted from trash (whether thats done manually using the permanently delete button, or because theyve reached their time limit), pages will enter a retention period. Again, the default here is 30 days, but workspace owners can set this to be up to 10 years.
- Purged pages Pages that have been deleted from the trashandhave passed their retention period are purged from the system and are not restorable by anyone.

##########################################

### Accessing content from the trash
Anyone that had access to a page can find and recover it from the trash using the left hand sidebar. This way, most of your Notion teammates can self-serve in the case of accidents.
As an Enterprise workspace owner, you can restore deleted pages once they enter the retention period.
Enterprise workspace owners can also use Content Search to find pages in the trash and restore them. To access Content Search, navigate to Settings and members in the left hand sidebar. You'll find Content Search under the Workspaces section.

Select Retained pages from the drop down menu and locate the page you want to restore.

##########################################

## Restoring retained pages
For retained pages, pages that were deleted from trash and are still in the retention period, workspace owners can use the admin content search to find and restore them.
When you do this, youll find two options. Heres how we suggest you use each:
- Restore page to give access to other workspace members This will restore a page to its original location, granting access back to those who originally had it. Youll most likely use this in the case of accidents (because they can happen!) like unintended page deletions or provisioning errors.

##########################################

- Restore to your private pages to keep things confidential This will move the page into your (the restorers) private page section,withoutgranting access to anyone else in your workspace. This can be handy when you need to restore pages behind the scenes, like in the case of a sensitive legal or HR matter.

# Organize, connect, and scale your Notion knowledge management system
Scattered or incomplete company knowledge can slow down onboarding, delay client projects, and create silos between teams.
But, with a centralized hub in Notion, everyone has instant access to up-to-date information, so they dont need to waste time asking for details or reinventing processes for each new project.
With all your knowledge organized, you can standardize work, increase your efficiency, and focus on delivering results and scaling your business.
This guide will show you how a simple system for gathering company knowledge can evolve into a connected Notion workspace where work and knowledge live side by side.

##########################################

## Create your company home
Think of your company home as a page where key information is laid out clearly so team members can find what they need on a self-serve basis.
Start a new page in your general teamspace that everyone has access to, and add sub-pages for all the information you need, from pitch templates to office information, benefits policies, and more.
Organize pages under relevant headers, add links or embed files, and insert databases and charts to show helpful snippets of information.

##########################################

Your home page could include:
- Your companys mission statement Put your mission statement, vision, and values front and center to keep everyone aligned.
- A directory of team members Details about who does what at your company, and how to contact them, is especially useful for remote or distributed teams.
- Policies and benefits Employees can find out how to book time off, how to file their expenses, and discover other benefits you offer.
- Standard operating procedures Create step-by-step guides for onboarding, approvals, reporting, and more.
- Client manuals Give your team members clear guidelines on how to work with clients, from onboarding to collaboration and deliverables.
- Performance metrics Your total yearly revenue so far split by client, shown as a chart.

##########################################

- Quick links to your deal pipeline or projects Get an overview of active leads and ongoing projects for easy access from the company home page.
- PTO calendar With a linked view of your vacation calendar, everyone can see upcoming leave and plan accordingly.
Ultimately, Notion's flexibility means you can customize this home page to include everything you need.
## Knowledge isnt confined to your handbook
Notion databases help you keep larger sets of data organized, searchable, and up to date.
Client records, project tracking, meeting notes, or other complex sets of information benefit from being categorized and tagged in a database.

##########################################

Choose from various layouts (Table, Board, Calendar, etc.) and adddatabase properties, which help to categorize, organize, and filter information efficiently.
### Here are three ways you might use databases:
Manage client information and relationships
As you welcome more clients to your roster, its helpful to store client details, projects and proposals in databases.
- A table to collect information about every client Using aTableorBoardlayout, enter each client in your database. Add person properties to tag your point of contact and the account manager. You could create fields for contact details, status (Prospect, Lead, Active Customer, etc), and source of the lead.

##########################################

- Link clients to projects and meeting notes Relation properties allow you to link items in separate databases. You could use a Relation properties to connect meeting notes and projects to your client database. That way, youll be able to access all client interactions and work from your client page.
- Build client portals for better collaboration Give each client their own portal which contains helpful resources, assets and files, and an overview of ongoing campaigns, projects, and deliverables. Portals keep your clients updated and provide transparency as you collaborate. You can publish these to the web usingNotion sitesoradd your point of contact as a guestwithin your workspace.

##########################################

### Track leads, proposals, and projects in one place
You can track all ongoing work in a database where you manage tasks and deadlines, assign project owners, and update project status.

##########################################

Depending on what kind of services you offer, you might:
- Visualize your content production workflow Use a Kanban-styleBoardview to track the progress of blog posts, videos, or social content. Columns can represent stages like Idea, Drafting, Review, Approved, and Published. And, you can create sub-groups to slice content based on the requesting client. Drag and drop the project cards to easily update progress.
- Monitor client campaigns from start to finish TheTimelinelayout can be used to track the lifecycle of marketing campaigns, PR launches, or ad placements. Link a task database to break larger initiatives into individual tasks and help team members complete their deliverables on time.

##########################################

- Arrange projects on a deadline calendar Stay aligned on deadlines and deliverables with a sharedCalendarlayout. Instead of having to contact you for status updates, clients can monitor progress and can leave feedback on projects.
### Record activity and meetings
Keep a record of what happens in internal meetings and client calls with a meeting notes database.

##########################################

- Tag meeting attendees Use aPersonproperty to tag everyone who attends a meeting.
- Record dates and times You can later sort to show the most recent meetings, or filter all meetings that took place this month.
- Log discussions, decisions, and action items in a database entry Use the database page as your space for taking notes, recording action items, and logging key decisions and outcomes.
- Link meeting notes to clients With aRelationproperty, you can connect meeting notes to your client database to easily review all client meetings about a particular project.
- Use templates to standardize meeting agendas Create templates for client introductions and kickoff calls to make sure meetings are productive and everyone stays on-topic.

##########################################

## Connect the dots between knowledge and daily work
Company knowledge shouldnt just be a collection of documents.
In Notion, your knowledge is dynamic and connects to all aspects of your work.
### Surface insights with AI
You can use Notion AI to surface information and extract insights, even when you dont know where it is, or what a document might be called.
You can ask natural language questions like What was discussed in last weeks sales meeting? or Show me the campaign plan for our newest client.
AI will not only surface the relevant pages, but provide a succinct answer based on the page content, and summarize key insights so you can review a long document without reading everything.

##########################################

### Collaborate seamlessly with colleagues and clients
Collaborating internally and with clients is effortless.
Add your comments at the top of a page, or on any specific block on the page, using the@to tag a team member in a comment.
You can bring clients into your workspace as guests and use commenting to review drafts and work-in-progress with your clients.
### Sync content across the workspace
With your knowledge organized theres no need to duplicate work.
Notions synced blocks mean you can resurface the same information in different places, and when the original block is edited, it will update everywhere.

##########################################

You could use synced blocks to put a copy of your Q3 goals in your company home page, resurface your clients contact info or bio in a project scope doc, or include your company details in customer-facing docs.
### Incorporate work from other tools
Its inevitable that some knowledge will live in other tools, like when your clients send examples in PDFs, share project briefs in a Google Doc, or designers work in Figma.
But, just because information lives outside of Notion doesnt mean it should be inaccessible.
You can embed content from other tools directly into Notion pages, and through AI Connectors, Notion AI can also reach into other tools like Slack and Gmail to provide even more context and accurate results.

##########################################

### Give everyone access to what they need
Sharing and permission settings let you control the level of access team members have to workspace content.

##########################################

Flexible permission settings mean that:
- Every team can have a corner for their work Teamspaces let you divide up the workspace by department, so each team has a separate area to build their own wikis and store relevant information. Teamspaces can be Open (anyone can join) or Closed (you need an invite).
- Permissions can be customized at page level Adjust who can edit pages with different settings like Full access, Can edit, or Can comment. Wiki pages, like your benefits policy, should be Read only for all except certain managers.
- Invite clients into your workspace Clients can join your workspace as guests, so you can share content and collaborate with them. Invite them to a client portal or home page that contains all the work you do together.

# Organize your everyday life with Notion AI
Getting your life in gear can feel overwhelming. You want to plan everything from your weekly meals to your next big trip, and maybe youd love to push your career forward by updating your resume or redesigning your daily habits and goals.
You can do all that in Notion, and with AI, its even more intuitive and fun to set up systems to advance your life.
If you already organize aspects of your life in Notion, you can boost your productivity, creativity, and effectiveness by adding AI to your workspace.
In this guide, youll learn how to integrate Notion AI into your daily life to write, make plans, get inspired, take on new challenges, and achieve your goals.

##########################################

But first, a quick overview of the technology behind Notion AI.
## Notion AI: Your virtual personal assistant
Notion AI works like any Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology:
- It looks for patterns in a massive set of data, referred to as training data, to create a model
- It tests its model by asking a question it already knows the answer to and analyzing how accurate its answer is. The data the AI uses here is called test data.
- Over time and with more inputs and training data, it learns and iterates on the model

##########################################

Using this process, Notion AI can generate text, brainstorm ideas, improve writing, translate, summarize, and much more. It considers all the data it has access to, plus the context of the page you're on, and produces text in response to your questions.
Whats special about Notion AI is that its built-in to your workspace. Theres no need to sign up for different tools and copy and paste responses from one app to another. You can call up Notion AI to help you with whatever you need without breaking your flow.
Rate AI content with thumbs-up or thumbs-down

##########################################

As with all kinds of AI technology, responses can sometimes be inaccurate or misleading.Use the thumbs-up and thumbs-down buttons to report great or not-so-great Notion AI responses. This helps our engineers improve the technology for everyone!You can read more about the limitations of AIhere.
### Get started with Notion AI
To get started with Notion AI, go to a new line and press thespacekey.
Now you can input a prompt. You can ask for anything - try requesting a definition of a concept (such as AI), ideas about a topic, or an outline for a document.

##########################################

Heres a brief overview of some things Notion AI can do:
- Create a summary of a long article or webpage Ask AI to summarize the text from an article, and it will generate a short paragraph.
- Extract themes from data, or create action items Notion AI can consider all information on a page and produce key takeaways like the themes from articles, class notes, journal entries, or even a list of action items from your notes.
- Turn bullet points into a fully-fledged doc You can quickly turn a few messy bullets into a complete document with the help of Notion AI, which will fill in the gaps and expand on your ideas.
- Improve your writing and grammarMake your writing instantly better with Notion AI, which can fix spelling and grammar mistakes, improve your sentences and change your tone.
- Generate text in a flash No more staring at a blank page or struggling to get started when you want to write. Notion AI can generate text in seconds based on your prompts and refine and edit until youre happy with your content.

##########################################

So, what can you actually do with such a powerful tool at your fingertips? Next, well look at some examples.
## Generate novel ideas with custom AI blocks
Planning your weekly meals in advance save you time and reduces daily decision-making.
Inside your Notion meal prep database, create a template for a new meal plan. Add a custom AI block to your template by going toInsert AI blocksin the/menu and choosingCustom AI block.
This AI block will produce text based on your instructions and take into account the other information on the page. So, any time you create a new database entry from your template, the custom AI block will be ready to go.

##########################################

Here are some different ways you could use custom AI blocks:
- Create a personalized weekly meal plan In your AI block, explain that you want to generate weekly meals that incorporate the Ingredients I have, which you will list below. You can make your prompt more specific by asking for spicy recipes or meals that dont contain nuts. When you clickGenerate, Notion AI will suggest recipes that fit your criteria.

##########################################

- Make a shopping list for your weekly meals Once youve decided on your recipes, ask Notion AI to create a shopping list of all the ingredients youdonthave for those meals. This will save you a ton of time drawing up your weekly grocery list, and make sure you only buy what you need.
- Decide where to go for your next trip You can use a custom Notion AI block to come up with some ideas for where to go on your next trip. Outside the block, define some criteria for your desired destination - such as climate, family-friendliness, or nightlife.

##########################################

- Plan travel activities Once youve generated some destinations, you can ask Notion AI to recommend activities to do in each place. Customize the results by including your budget, length of stay, and fitness level in the prompt.
As well as custom blocks, you can use a Summary block to summarize the content of any page or an Action item block to pull action items from a page.

## Conquer writers block and create any kind of document
Notion AI can help you write from scratch and turn a few messy bullets, notes, or ideas into a fully-fledged document.

##########################################

You can use this to write resumes, cover letters, work emails, and anything else you can think of.
Here are some ways to write better with Notion AI:
- Avoid the blank page and kickstart your writing If youre not sure where to start, ask Notion AI toHelp me write. Explain what kind of content you need to create and give plenty of details. For example, if you want to write a cover letter, explain the position, industry, and company youre applying to.
- Improve your rough draft If you have an outline or draft, you can ask Notion AI to improve your writing, simplify technical words, expand on your ideas by writing more, or even change the tone to sound friendlier, more professional, or casual.

##########################################

- Write and rewrite until youre happy with the result Notion AI can rewrite some or all of the text to include new information or adjust the content in any way. You can say something like Rewrite the opening sentence to sound more confident, or Give more details about my customer service experience, or just ask Notion AI to change the tone.
- Run a final spelling and grammar check Notion AI can proofread your document before you send it off to make sure its free from typos or mistakes.

##########################################

Everyone needs to produce well-written documents from time to time. Now, you dont have to write from scratch or agonize over the wording of the cover letter before applying for a new role. Notion AI speeds up your writing process and helps you create perfectly crafted documents that convey precisely what you want to say.
## Expand your horizons with Notion AI
You can use AI to expand your thinking and achieve more in any area of life
Notion AI will be your creative partner, helping you brainstorm ideas and turn them into action plans and results.

##########################################

Here are some ways to achieve more in life with Notion AI:
- Get help setting your annual or quarterly goals Notion AI can help you brainstorm ideas for personal and professional goals. Write down all the things youd like to change or achieve in your life. Then, create aCustom AI blockprompting Notion AI to suggest goals based on those criteria.
- Create an action plan to achieve your goals Once youve set some goals, you can ask Notion AI to generate an action plan of steps to achieve those goals, which you can customize accordingly.
- Use AI as a tool for self-reflection If you journal in Notion, you can use anAction itemsblock to extract tasks to do from your journal entries. You could also create a Custom AI block asking Notion AI to find common themes from your journal. This can help you better understand where you currently are and where youd like to go in life.
- Get personalized recommendations for books, movies, and music Notion AI can generate personalized recommendations based on what you already love. Prompt AI to give you entertainment recommendations based on your favorites.
- Decide on a daily routine or habits Struggling to decide which habits youd like to establish? Use a custom AI block to determine what habits to build based on your goals, lifestyle, and behaviors you want to cultivate.

##########################################

### Better prompting means better results from Notion AI
You can generate almost any kind of content with AI just by writing a few great prompts and follow-up prompts.

##########################################

The key is to include the three components of a good prompt:
- Type of contentExplain what type of content you want to create, or choose an option from the dropdown menu. For example, an email, project plan or recipe.
- Topic you want to cover Include as much information in your prompts about the topic as possible. This is where youll explain that you want to send an email to your boss or create a project plan for your kitchen renovation.
- Desired formatTell Notion AI whether you want the results formatted in paragraph, bullet points, a table, or something else, and state the required length.
Youll get better, more relevant  results from Notion AI with detailed and specific prompts.

##########################################

If you're not satisfied with the initial output, don't worry! You can always ask AI to edit the text, improve writing, make it longer or shorter, make the tone friendlier, and more.
However, it's important not to over-engineer your prompts, as the whole point of using AI is to save yourself time.

# Organize, manage, and track all your work with a personal dashboard
The best productivity system is the one that works for you.
But most software doesnt allow you to customize it  youre forced to shoehorn your system into a simple text list or cards on a Kanban board. Whats more, these apps probably live outside of where your team is working, so you have to bounce between multiple pieces of software to see what you need to do (then another to actually do it).
Using Notion, you can create a totally customized system that helps you organize, manage, and track everything youre working on. And if your team is already using Notion, you can easily connect cross-functional work to your personal dashboard (well show you how).

##########################################

Here is everything youll need to build the optimal system for your own personal work dashboard in Notion.
## Track everything you need to do  big or small
At the core of every personal work dashboard is task management  how do we keep track of what needs to get done and when it needs to get done by?
The first step is to decide if you want to use a database. While databases are great for managing workflows with many parts, they might not be necessary for a simple list of to-do's. It all depends on the work youre doing and and how you want to track it.

##########################################

Usebasic blocksif:
- You prefer simplicity & speed.
- Your tasks are straightforward, and are more did you do them or did you not?
- You like that satisfying feeling of checking things off your to-do list.
Use adatabaseif:
- Your work has many parts  like a project that might require its own set of sub-tasks.
- You need a way to organize tasks by sorting and filtering for specific properties.
- Youre a visual person, and want to see you all your work laid out by priority level, due date, and more.
- You care about being able to revisit work that was previously completed.

##########################################

Our suggestion? Start simple and build on top of it. Begin with basic blocks, and if your processes require it, turn it into a tasks database.Keep in mind, the value your system delivers should always be greater than the work it takes to upkeep the system.
### Basic blocks
If you decide to start simple and use basic blocks to track your tasks, then the foundation of your system will be theto-doblock.
To create a to-do block, you can either type/to-door[ ]. The to-do block allows you to easily create a checkbox item, as well as give you the ability to satisfyingly cross things off as you go. From there, you can add a due date and set up a reminder for the task if youd like (by using the@symbol).

##########################################

Another helpful block for simple task management is the toggle block. To create a toggle, you can either type/toggleor>. The toggle block allows you to nest blocks within it so you can neatly track projects that may contain several tasks.
Hereis a template you can duplicate thats built using basic blocks. We organized to-do blocks incolumnsby clicking thesymbol to drag-and-drop text, which creates side-by-side sections. Alternatively, type/columnsto choose the number of columns you want to create. You can also drag-and-drop to move tasks from one column to another, or even to an Archive sub-page to keep a record of previously completed tasks.

##########################################

### Databases
If your tasks have several moving parts or dependencies, databases might be the better option for you. Databases allow you to filter, sort, and customize properties to manage tasks however you best see fit. But our advice still stands  keep things simple, and layer on functionality only if your workflow requires it.
Well start with a few pillars of a task management database that you can customize and iterate upon as you go.
If you need a quick primer on databases
Click to expand

##########################################

### Properties
- Status setting aStatushelps you keep track of exactly where the task is at. Simply add aStatusproperty to your database and you can choose from three default options: Not started, In progress, and Done. You can also customize these to be called whatever you want.
- Date by using theDateproperty, you can easily assign and track important dates for each task. The most common one we see is setting a due date for each task.
- Select theSelectproperty allows you to create and customize how you tag tasks in your database. Any tags youve created will show up as a dropdown list to choose from. We often see users leverage theSelectproperty to create tags for priority (High, Medium, Low) or the project type.

##########################################

### Views
Database views give you the power to customize how you visualize your tasks and surface the information you need in an instant.
- Table view tasks are displayed in rows and their relevant properties are the columns. This is a great for getting a birds eye view of all your tasks in one place.
- Calendar view great for planning and seeing important dates, like theDue dateof all your tasks at once (our marketing team loves this one for theircontent calendar).
- Board view allows you to group tasks based on properties, likeStatusorPriority. Users love the drag-and-drop functionality of the board view which allows you to seamlessly move a task from one status to another.

##########################################

You can draw inspiration fromthis Tasks Databaseor duplicate it directly into your workspace. The template includes pre-built views of what weve outlined:
- Board view organized by status
- Board view organized by priority
- Table view of all tasks
- Calendar view of due dates
## Bring company-wide context into your personal dashboard
In addition to tracking your tasks, its also important that youre able to contextualize how your work fits in with the rest of the organization. Notion makes it easy to add context from cross-functional teams as well as connect other tools directly into your personal work dashboard.

##########################################

### Linked databases
Having a through-line from your personal work to the companys goals helps build alignment. You can see that what youre doing directly rolls up into what the company wants to accomplish  and having them right in your personal dashboard can help bring focus to your work.
Type/linked view of databaseand select the source database you want to include. From there, you can use filters and sorts to customize further. For example, this company-wide goals database might have specific goals for marketing, sales, engineering, and more. But lets say youre on the engineering team. You can filter to only see the goals that engineering is responsible for.

##########################################

When you create a linked database, remember that filters only apply to the linked database you created. However, any changes you make to the content or properties in the linked database will be reflected in the original database.
### Link previews
With the power oflink previews, you can bring all of your most important tools into Notion. Link previews allow you to see live, synced visualizations of links directly in Notion. This is currently supported by several major platforms (GitHub, Jira, Slack, Asana, etc.).
This gives live updates from other tools right inside your personal work dashboard  so you can build workflows with the most up-to-date information.

##########################################

For example, you might have some work thats dependent on an in-progress bug fix the engineering team is handling. You can paste a link from Jira right in your personal dashboard and see when that task has been complete, instead of needing to go into Jira and check the status of the bug fix.

# How engineering and product teams use Notion for sprint planning
## Getting to know sprints in Notion
Engineering and product teams rely on sprints to get hyper-focused and ship new features and products by setting time-boxed goals to complete tasks.
You can set up and track sprints with Notion by combining projects, tasks, and sprint management. Your teams project management system lives alongside all your documentation in a seamless, connected workspace where you have access to built-in AI to help you get more done, faster.

##########################################

In this guide, youll learn:
- How to get a ready-made template for sprint planning, project, and task management
- Different ways to manage and automate your sprints in Notion
- How to customize sprint management and connect other aspects of your work
- Ways to use AI to accelerate your work
## How to get your sprint planning template
Weve created an out-of-the-boxtemplatefor managing projects, tasks, and sprints with interlinked databases

##########################################

To get this system in your workspace:
- Add the template Open the in-app Templates menu, and add the Projects, tasks, and sprints template to your teams teamspace. Youll now see 4 different views in your sidebar: Projects, Tasks, Sprints, and Sprint board.
- Add some tasks and projectsBefore you plan any sprints, start adding some tasks and projects in your new databases. You can fill out relevant properties and add tasks to their corresponding project.
- Navigate to your Sprint board to manage tasksHere, add tasks to your current sprint, update task progress and more.
Next, well tour the template to show you exactly how it works.

##########################################

## A tour of sprints in Notion
These core concepts power Notions sprints solution:
- Projects  These represent larger chunks of work (sometimes called epics) and can be broken down into tasks. This could include things like a feature launch or redesign of your site or app.
- Tasks The individual tasks related to a specific project that typically have a single responsible owner. Tasks can be further broken down into subtasks to help the owner manage and prioritize work throughout a day or week.
- Sprints Sprints are related to tasks and act as a container to organize work across time.
- Sprint board Your sprint board shows you all the tasks you have to do in the current sprint, arranged by project and task status.
Databases power this solution

##########################################

Notion databases are like digital filing cabinets, helping to organize your team's docs, meetings, tasks, and more. With special relation properties, you can seamlessly manage your work at any level of granularity and across any unit of time. Learn more about notion databaseshere.
The sprint planning template includes all you need to align your team and kick off sprints.
### See your current sprint in Sprint board
The Sprint board is your one-stop shop for sprint management. Here youll be able to view all tasks for your current and future sprints, grouped by status and project.
The default view of the Sprint board is filtered to show your current sprint.

##########################################

This view will help you:
- Focus on what needs to get doneThis view filters out all tasks that dont belong to the current sprint, eliminating distractions or confusion and helping you focus on what tasks are the highest priority.
- See tasks grouped according to their project Tasks in the Sprint board are grouped by the project they correspond to, so you can understand how much you have to do for each project and decide where to focus your energy.
- Quickly add a new taskClick onNewto create a new task. If you click underneath the project you want to create a task for, your task will automatically be connected to that project.

##########################################

- Update a task status by dragging and dropping When you start a task, drag it from theNot startedtoIn progresscolumn to update the status smoothly.
- Visually track your progress with completion percentage TheCompleted tasksproperty shows you the percentage of completed tasks for the sprint represented as a progress ring.
### Additional views for sprint management
TheSprint boardalso contains two views for planning sprints.

##########################################

- See whats next in sprint planning view This Table view shows your tasks grouped by sprint. Here, see whats coming up in the next sprint. You can move tasks forward to the next sprint, or add them to the backlog.
- Review your task backlog The Backlog view shows incomplete tasks that havent been assigned to a sprint. Here, add tasks to address later. Come back to this view when planning future sprints.
### Automatically complete sprints and start new ones
When youre done with a sprint, click theComplete sprintbutton on the current sprint view to automatically move unfinished tasks.

##########################################

When you click the button, youll be prompted to confirm the dates for your next sprint. Here you can decide whether to move unfinished tasks to your next sprint, send them to the backlog, or keep them in the current sprint.
For example, move high-priority, unfinished tasks to the next sprint, and put deprioritized tasks in the backlog. Tasks you no longer need to address can remain in the current sprint.
You never have to remember to create future sprints - this happens automatically when you complete your current sprint. This guarantees you always have an upcoming sprint and saves you from having to create one every time. Before you start a new sprint, you can adjust the start and end dates accordingly.

##########################################

### Seamless collaboration with GitHub
Notions Github workspace integration lets you link any Github pull requests with any task in Notion, and automatically shows the status of the pull request directly in your tasks database.
This integration helps teams collaborate smoothly and gives everyone  technical or not  visibility into work happening in other tools.
To set up the Github workspace integration, go toSettings & membersin your Notion sidebar. ClickMy connectionsand selectConnectnext to the Github (Workspace) app.
Find more detailed instructions for integrating Notion and Githubhere.

##########################################

To link a pull request with one of your tasks:
- First, create the task in your Notion tasks database.
- Copy theUnique Task ID, which is automatically generated. This is how you will cross reference and link tasks in Notion and Github.
- In Github, paste the Task ID into the title of the pull request
- The pull request will now be linked in the Notion database entry, and a link will be available on the Github side. If you dont see it, try pasting the GitHub link into your new PR property.
You can also configure how you want theStatusproperty to update when the status of the pull request changes. Learn morehere.

##########################################

You can have multiple status automations, meaning if you have one Merged PR (which would update the status property as complete) and you then link a second Open pull request, the Task will revert back to Open state. This is helpful if you need multiple pull requests to complete one task.
Locate tasks easily with a Unique ID
When you create a new task it will have an automatically generatedUnique ID.
Not only can this be used for linking and referencing to pull requests in Github - it can also help you locate database items faster.

##########################################

## Go further by customizing your project management setup
Notion is flexible and fully customizable. You can add new properties, views and layouts so your team can view information in a variety of helpful ways. You can also use automation and AI to speed up your work.
### Customizing your projects, tasks, and sprint management databases
- View my sprint board Duplicate the current sprint view and set a filter such that it only shows tasks for Me. Then save for everyone, so the view will show tasks assigned to whoever is currently logged in and viewing the database.

##########################################

- Assess team members workload Group your teams task database by Assignee to quickly review how much work everyone has on their plate.
- Connect meeting notes and docs to project managementUse aRelationproperty to connect projects to relevant documentation. Then, the context behind your work will only be a click away. Learn about how to use relation propertieshere.
- Automatically add new tasks with a button Create abuttonanywhere in your workspace which can simplify work and complete multiple actions at once. For example, a Create new task button adds a new task to your database and fills out various properties simultaneously.

##########################################

### Enhance efficiency and creativity with Notion AI
Notion AI is your built-in AI assistant that can help with all aspects of your work.

##########################################

Your projects database comes with an AI Summary property which automatically generates a real-time summary of your project page content. You can add another custom AI autofill property to databases with your own prompt. Use this to:
- Automatically write a user story Ask Notion AI to write a user story based on information on your project page to help your team understand the problem they are solving for users.
- Pull out risks and blockers from a project pageNotion AI can extract potential risks or blockers from your project page content and bring these to your attention as a database property. You could also ask to list out key results.

##########################################

- Brainstorm new product ideas If you need to prepare ideas for an upcoming meeting, Notion AI can be your brainstorming partner. SelectBrainstorm ideasin the AI menu and explain what you want to come up with. You could even ask AI to help you come up with ideas for a feature name!
- Draft a project plan You can scope out a project plan in a few minutes using Notion AI. Ask Notion AI to help you write a project brief. It will generate a rough outline that you can customize and complete on your own or with more assistance from AI.

# Product teams nail cross-functional collaboration with these notes and docs templates
No one understands the value of trustworthy documentation better than product teams.
More than anyone, they're cross-functional and depend on collaboration with everyone from marketing and sales to engineering and design.
As a product leader, you need a single source of truth for all this disparate information  and a system to account for all the meetings and feedback comprising that truth.

##########################################

In this guide, well show you how to build two essential Notion setups tailored specifically for product teams  we'll call them Meeting Notes and Docs.Weve seen these work across hundreds of teams to inspire a culture of documentation, in which information is collected, centralized, organized, and nothing is ever lost or missed.
### In this piece, you'll learn
- 1Our step-by-step process for building Meeting Notes and Docs databases to house whatever information you need.
- 2How you can customize and arrange these databases any way you like using properties, filters and sorting.
- 3Tips and best practices from the Notion team specifically for product leaders to become more effective.

##########################################

## By the end, you'll be able to build both of these:
Well-executed projects are built on solid documentation
Product teams need a place to corral all the miscellaneous parts of their work. Whether its meeting notes where decisions are made, or a document where important brainstorming happens, organized documentation holds projects together.

##########################################

Without a solid note-taking system in place, product teams might:
- Lose track of whats discussed in meetings decision-making context, action items, and all the most important parts of a meeting wont get remembered or executed.
- Not be able to access important notes and documents theyre scattered in different places, leading to duplicated work and operation without necessary context.
- A lack of transparency in your org or company-wide siloed notes and docs means siloed teammates who work without insight into what other PMs are doing.
- Forget about your users needs product teams are driven by solving their users problems. Projects can go off-track if that vision isn't documented somewhere central.

##########################################

Remember, your product team can use Notion to organize all their most important information and manage projects

##########################################

Building and implementing these two note-taking systems in Notion will help your team:
- Collaborate more effectively unite all teams on a project, no matter what time zone theyre in. Everythings documented so no one misses important info relevant to their work.
- Build foundational knowledge everyone can learn from teams compound learnings when they can see all the context, edge cases and perspectives that factor into decisions.
- Reduce distraction cut down on the number of apps you use at once as Notion lets you take notes, collaborate, manage information and track progress in a single workspace.
- Maintain consistent qualitydocumentation helps your team approach problems with the same set of criteria, helping to establish a process everyone follows for effective work.

##########################################

Notion puts your notes and docs alongside your product teams everyday work. This helps inform execution for every project from all teams involved.
## Give your team an edge with Meeting Notes and Docs
Well show you how to create two resources with a single framework.
### 1. A database thats your home base for all meetings and docs
Notion has many different types of database views  galleries, calendars, tables, boards and lists. For now, well start with a simple list database, but you can add more views later.
In your sidebar, click+to add a new page to your workspace. From there, you can selectListto turn your page into a list database.

##########################################

Make two of these databases, one for Meeting Notes and Docs. If youd like to make your databases stand out and easier to find, go ahead and select an emoji for your page. Youll see that by default you have several blank pages in your list to start. Delete them or open one up to start editing it.
Your Meeting Notes database will organize all your meetings, from weekly syncs to those ad-hoc brainstorms with engineering about a difficult project.
Your Docs list will be where PMs can post project specs for feedback or share ideas for process improvements. Theyre all in one place and easily found, making them useful for your entire team.

##########################################

### 2. Customize your databases to fit your teams needs
Notion databases are fully customizable so you can build the system that fits the way your team works.

##########################################

- Add properties these are details about the items in your database. For instance, for meetings, properties can be added to show who attended, when the meeting took place, what team it involved, etc. Click thePropertiesmenu to add new ones. Just choose the type of properties you want (Person,Date,Select, etc.) and give them names. These will make it easy to filter and sort your database as needed.
- Showing properties on your list you can decide which properties youd like to see in your list by clicking the properties menu and using the toggles to show or hide existing properties in the database. For example, in Docs you might want to see the type of doc and who created it. In Meetings, you might choose to see the date and time, the type of meeting, and who was there.
- Creating filters to add filters to your database, click onFilterin the database menu, and then+ Add a filter. Here you can filter your database to show only pages with certain properties. Use the drop downs to select the property and how you want to apply the filter. For example, in your Docs list, you can choose to only see docs where the type is Spec."
- Sorting your list click onSortin the database menu. Choose the property youd like to sort by. For example, sort your meetings by date by selecting theCreatedproperty and choosingDescendingto show the most recent meetings first.
- Views you can add multiple views to your database to arrange your information in different ways. Click+ Add a viewat the top left. Here you can create alternative views with different filters applied. For example, a view for only marketing meetings. You can change the type of database to board, table, calendar, etc. this way too, and toggle back and forth between different views in seconds.

##########################################

Here are a few property recommendations just for product leaders using these databases:
- Last edited timethis is useful for tracking progress and seeing the most recent updates.
- Type of doc using aSelectproperty, youll add all the different types of documents you create (technical spec, architecture overview, etc).
- StatusaSelectproperty helps you assign a status to documents (in progress, for review, etc).
- Reviewerswith aPersonproperty, tag anyone who needs to review the document.
- Priority assign a priority level with aSelectproperty. This will come in handy later if you want to arrange your docs in order of priority.

##########################################

- When the meeting took placeuse theCreated timeproperty so you can see when a meeting was and organize your list with the most recent at the top.
- Type of meeting using aSelectproperty, add different types of meetings to choose from, like weekly stand-ups or bi-monthly syncs between product and design.
- Meeting participants with aPersonproperty tag, document everyone present in the meeting.

##########################################

And here are some database views that product teams may find helpful:
- Whats current filter to see all documents tagged in progress or that relate to an ongoing project. For instance, documents where you're actively collecting feedback.
- Doc type set up views to see different types of docs, such as a view for all your technical specs and another for project proposals or research.
- Where youre tagged only show docs or notes where you are tagged or you have action items to complete.

##########################################

- This week's meetings a table view that's filtered to show only meetings from this week. HitFilterwhereMeeting dateandis withinandThe past week.
- Your meetings see all meetings that youve participated in or where youre tagged and have follow-up tasks to complete.
- High priority only view high priority meetings. Add options like P1, P2 and P3 using aSelectproperty to indicate priority level and filter to see only P1s.
- Calendar add a calendar view to see all your upcoming or past meetings organized on the calendar.
With Notions custom properties and filtered views, you wont have to wade through reams of data to find what you need. You can surface the information that is relevant to the task at hand.

##########################################

### 3. Format pages however you need
Its time to start adding some pages to your databases. Every page in your database can be structured however you want  a feature that's unique to Notion.
HitNewat the top right and an empty page will pop up on your screen. This is where you'll take your meeting notes or write documents.

##########################################

Every Notion page is a blank canvas. You can add elements to it by hitting+in the margin or typing/to bring up your menu of choices. This is how you can add text, headings, bullets, checkboxes, and much more. Here are some key advantages:
- Create headers there are three different types of headers,H1(the largest),H2, andH3(the smallest). Use them to help you organize information. For instance, a set of meeting notes might have anH1header for Action Items withH2headers underneath for the different teams responsible for them.
- Add media Notion makes it easy to assemble images, videos, PDFs, files, quotes, recordings, and embeds from 500+ apps inside pages so they truly can be put to use however you need. Just drag what you want into the widow or hit/to find the right item.
- Drag & drop arrange and rearrange content in seconds using theicon. You can even create columns (the blue lines will guide you). You can also drag pages under headers and pages into other pages to nest them for further organization.

##########################################

Given their flexibility, you can use Notion pages for all kinds of things.
In your Docs database, you might have an audio file from an interview youve done with a user discussing a new feature request. In your Meeting Notes database, might have an image of an app redesign you need to discuss with your design team.
All of these blocks come together inside Notion pages, so your team doesnt have to leave your Meeting Notes or Docs database to get work done. Everything lives side-by-side.
Here are some embeds that are particularly beneficial to product teams
Click to expand

##########################################

### 4. Templates reinforce helpful processes
Now you see that you can create fully-custom, beautifully-designed pages in Notion. Once you create helpful page structures, you can replicate them easily with templates.
This will save time by instantly generating a new page created in the format you need, and this is a great way to standardize processes for taking meeting notes or creating certain types of docs.
Do you need your weekly meeting page to always have your quarterly goals at the top? Use a template. Want to make sure all your teams product specs have the same criteria? Use a template. This makes everything efficient, clear, and unforgettable.
To create a template, click the arrow next to theNewbutton on the database. Select+ New template.

##########################################

Now youre editing a template. Anything you do here will be reflected every time you use the template. But dont worry  youre not stuck using it forever. If theres something you notice that could make your template better, just update it. And whenever you use the template going forward, itll have your updated version.

##########################################

Here are a few ideas for useful templates you could create:
- Ad Hoc for random, general meetings that may arise, add anH2header for Discussion Points, followed by anotherH2for Action Items with a to-do list underneath.
- Weekly sync for a weekly meetings template, addH2slike Review of the past week, What we will do this week and Potential blockers. These can all be followed by a bullet list. Then, a finalH2for Action Items, with a checklist.
- Kickoffs start with anH2Overview, and add some text underneath, for example, What is the project, and why are we working on this? Then, add otherH2s: Problem Statement, Proposed Solution," Success Criteria, User Stories, Scope. Short prompts or questions under each heading will help you fill the page out quickly.
- Sprint planning for a meeting to plan a sprint, include headers like Sprint Goal to get clear on what youll accomplish, then Spring Backlog, Team & Roles and Notes.
- Post-mortemto analyze the outcome of a project, useH2sfor User Facing Impact, and Timeline. Under a header for Relevant Metrics, prompt people to paste in graphs or links to data. In the template, include leading questions that encourage you to dig deep into the root cause, and figure out how to prevent future incidents.

##########################################

- RFC this stands for Request for Comment, and its a document we often use at Notion that invites teams to start a discussion about an idea. CreateH2ssuch as Problem where youll describe the issue youre trying to solve, followed by Context to provide some background information, Proposed Solution and Action Items.
- Technical Spec your product team can use a technical spec every time you start a project to state product requirements before development begins, without missing a detail. In your template, includeH2slike Summary, Background, Goals and Non-Goals to get clear on what you will, and wont, achieve. Then, add a section to propose solutions, breaking down the risks, milestones and open questions.
- Architecture Overview youll use this template any time you want to document specific software features and get aligned with engineers regarding any changes that need to be made. Include headers to describe the feature and its purpose, plus the client, server, and database.

##########################################

Now, when its time for the teams weekly sync or sprint planning meeting, just clickNewat the top right of your database and select the corresponding template. Then youll be ready to jump straight into planning the meeting and recording the outcomes, saving you and your team time.
### 5. Replicate your database across pages for easy access
In Notion, you can have the same database appear across a number of different pages. You can have your original database, and then a series of what we call "linked databases" elsewhere showing whatever view of the original you want.

##########################################

For example, you can have your original Meeting Notes database for your company, and then  on your marketing wiki  have a version of that same database showing only meeting notes tagged "marketing."
Create linked databases anywhere in your workspace by typing/linkedand selectingCreate a linked database. Then, youll choose the database you require, and your information will now appear as an in-line table inside the page.
Add the necessary filters to make sure your linked database only shows the information relevant to the page youre in. For example, in the homepage for the project youre launching next week, add a linked database which is filtered to show only meeting notes relevant to that project.

##########################################

You can use this linked database to easily add new project notes, which the entire company can see in the original database if they want. At the same time, you don't have to distract your project team with all company-wide notes. Everything syncs seamlessly!
## Tips from Notion
Of course, we here at Notion use Notion for our Meeting Notes and Docs systems. They help our product team stay aligned with all the cross-functional work theyre doing, and keep everyone updated on necessary information.
To help you use your Meeting Notes and Docs databases to their full potential, here are a few best practices from our team.

##########################################

- Connect your notes and docs to your projects using aRelationproperty, you can connect Docs and Meeting Notes to yourproduct team's project database. That way, everything related to a project is in one place. You can see why a decision was made on a project by looking through the old meeting notes associated with it. How to do ithere.
- Use backlinks to see where Meeting Notes or Docs pages are shared if youre sharing Meeting Notes or Docs elsewhere in Notion between teams, backlinks give you a map. You can see where a specific page has been shared, and where it hasnt. This helps your team easily navigate all related work. More info on backlinkshere.

##########################################

- Create a culture of documentation requiring that decisions, meetings, etc. all be documented helps your team learn collectively and onboard more easily. As a company, Notion actually has only one Meeting Notes database and one Docs database, and all teams use these two resources. That way, everyone in the company can see what individual teams or people are up to, and teams can use more granular views and linked databases to focus on what's relevant to them.

# Project management that evolves with your team
Youve outgrown managing your projects in a chaotic spreadsheet or document where its hard to find information.
However, specialist project management tools overcomplicate your processes with rigid workflows and unnecessary steps.
What you need is a system that evolves with your team and lets you build exactly what you needfrom simple to-do lists and Kanban boards to charts that track complex projects across several teams.
Notion gives you the building blocks to create project trackers that reflect how you work.
Later, connect your docs, wiki, notes, and more in one workspace where team members have everything they need.

##########################################

In this guide, well show you how to create a custom project management system with Notion.
## Plan, execute, and manage work in one place
Project management is more than just tracking tasks: its about seeing the bigger picture.
In Notion, you can scope projects in your tracker, link tasks to projects, or write outlines and drafts right inside your editorial calendar.
Instead of just linking out to other tools, all your work is in one place, blurring the lines between docs and project management.
### Track your progress with databases
Unlike standard spreadsheets, Notion databases give your information a structured home where you can assign dynamic properties and categorize, sort, and filter information in numerous useful ways.

##########################################

Linking databases with aRelationproperty means that updates in one place reflect across the system.
For example, if you have a tasks database linked to your content calendar, whenever a job like Draft social media post or Create visuals is marked as done, the corresponding project moves a step closer to completion.
Some recommendations for your Projects database:
- Track projects with aStatusproperty Add aStatusproperty to your Projects database, and customize the property to include all the steps in your workflow.
- Drag and drop projects to update their status Choose aBoardlayout grouped byStatusto view each project as a card. When you want to update a projects status, just drag the card across the board.

##########################################

- Assign owners to your projects Use aPersonproperty to tag members of your team as the owner of a project.
- View your project progress over time Add start and end dates to your projects. Then, youll be able to visualize projects over time using theTimelineview.
- Prioritize your work Create a prioritization system with theSelectproperty. Tag each project according to priority (P0, P1, etc) to help your team achieve high-priority goals.
You can add a similar set of properties to your Tasks database: aStatusproperty to track progress, aPersonproperty to assign owners, and aDateproperty to keep deadlines clear.
Advanced database properties
Click to expand

##########################################

### Work inside your project pages
Pages in a database are infinitely customizable. Combine text blocks, images, videos, embeds, and files ****to plan and execute directly in your project tracker, so all your work is easy to find.
You can draft and edit blog posts inside your content calendar, outline and scope a new project within your tracker, or add a checklist to a task page to ensure every step is completed.
Project pages can also have as many sub-pages as you need to keep related work organized and accessible.
Database templates improve consistency and help your team work faster. Set up and customize templates for outlines, project scopes, or content briefs, so team members dont have to start from a blank page.

##########################################

### Customize your system
Once youve built the foundations of your project management system, you can experiment with different ways to organize your information.
For example:
- See your projects in various layouts There are seven different database layouts in Notion. Try viewing your Projects as aTimeline,Table, orChart.
- Choose which properties show up on your board In the Properties menu, you can select all the properties you want to show up when youre looking at the Board.
- Group and Sort information in different ways You can group your tasks by project and sort them by priority. Projects can be sorted in date order, and grouped by Status.

##########################################

- Visualize project progress Use aRollupproperty in your Projects database to display the percentage of completed tasks per project. You can view it as a progress ring, bar, or percentage.
- Filter databases to view subset of information Add a filter to show only high priority tasks, tasks related to a particular project, or projects owned by a person.
- Get a dynamic summary of projects Use the AI summary property to automatically generate a summary of the project, making it easy to get an at-a-glance view of where your project stands. The AI summary automatically updates as the Project changes.
In Notion, one database can have several saved views.
Add a new view, rename it, and organize the information however you want.

##########################################

Then, tab through your database views to see the same information in different ways.
### Connect and collaborate seamlessly
Tech teams often depend on specialized tools. But, with Notion, you can bring work from other tools into your Notion pages, bridging the gap between departments for smoother collaboration.

##########################################

- Embed pages from other tools Use anEmbedblock to insert Figma files, Google docs, Miro boards, Loom videos and much more onto a Notion page where they can be seen by all.
- Importing existing content Notion has asimple importerallowing you to easily migrate existing content from tools like Confluence or Asana.
- Sync content across technical tools Createsynced databasesthat mirror the work happening in specialist tools like Jira or Github, to avoid silos and give everyone total visibility.
- Collaborate through Slack Connect Slack accounts for smooth collaboration to ensure nothing gets missed. You can set updatabase automationsto ping team members on Slack when a projects status is updated, or a task is assigned to someone.

##########################################

Plus, you can resurface your projects and tasks in different places across the workspace.

##########################################

For example:
- View projects in the team wiki Add a linked view of the projects database to your team wiki so its easy to see whats on everyones plate.
- Tasks appear in your personal home page Each member of your team has a custom, dynamic home page that surfaces relevant information for them. Theyll get a widget of tasks assigned to them appear in their home page.
- Reference a project or task You can use the @ to tag a project or task page anywhere in the workspace. For example, you can link back to a project or task in a doc.
- Link meeting notes or docs to projects Use a Relation property to connect other databases, such as your meeting notes or docs databases. This helps you access relevant meeting notes or docs from a project page.

##########################################

- Comment and mention team members on a page Start a conversation on any page either at the top of the page or on a specific block, and tag someone in your team to draw attention to something.
### A tool that grows with your company
Once youve started managing projects and tasks in Notion, you can expand into other areas of work.
Having everything in one place makes it easier for your team to stay focused, find information and collaborate across departments.

##########################################

- Track all your meetings Use a database to store meeting notes so you can easily refer back to them.
- Record user feedback in a database Make a customer feedback database to organize what customers say. You can use the AI property to extract key insights from the data.
- Build a roadmap for your product team Track product development with a roadmap and launch calendar.
- Manage customer relationships Create a lightweight CRM to manage your contacts and build relationships with customers.
- Document your processes Use Notion as a documentation tool. Docs are aesthetic and clean by default, so theres no need to spend hours on formatting. Share documents with team members or guests, and even publish them to the web.
- Create a wiki for your company A wiki keeps all key information structured and easy to access for everyone on your team. You can build and customize a simple wiki that gives your team access to all the information they need daily.
- Be more efficient with AI Notion AI is a powerful tool built right into your workspace. Ask questions and get insights about workspace content, draft and edit documents in minutes, refer to content in external tools and much more.

# Share social media posts from Notion with webhook actions
Work happens across many different tools. That's why we've made it simple to connect Notion withhundreds of your favorite apps so you can bring everything into one united workspace. When your tools work together smoothly, you can focus on what matters. And with webhooks, you can do even more  connecting Notion's automation features with any tool you need, even beyond our integration library.
Think of webhook actions as digital bridges connecting Notion to other tools you use. They provide a simple way to link Notion with other appsno coding needed. With tools like Zapier or Make, you can set up automatic workflows that handle tasks for you.

##########################################

In this guide, well walk you through how to publish social media posts using webhook actions and share some helpful ways to make your workflow easier.
## How do webhook actions work with Notion?
When something happens in Notion (like marking a task complete), these messengers instantly notify your other appskeeping everything in sync without you having to do the work.
Let's break down how webhook actions work in Notionthey're simpler than you might think! When you set up a webhook action, Notion sends updates (HTTP events) to other apps (that's just tech-speak for sending data securely over the internet).

##########################################

There are two easy ways to trigger webhook actions in Notion:
- Through database automationslike when you check off a task
- Using button blocksfor when you want to trigger an action manually

##########################################

## Automated social media posting with webhook actions
Let's say you manage your team's social media workflow in Notion. Wouldn't it be great if posts could automatically go live once they're approved? Instead of manually checking for approvals and publishing content, you can use webhook actions to handle it for you. For example, when the final reviewer marks a post as "Approved" in your social media database, webhook actions can automatically trigger the publishing process. In our example, we'll see how Notion and Make work together to have something posted automatically on LinkedIn.

##########################################

### Generate a webhook URL
Before you set up automations in Notion, you'll need a webhook URL from Make or your preferred third-party app. This will look slightly different in every tool, but the end result should be a URL that you can paste into your Notion automation. Check out the documentation of your preferred tool to learn more.
Now whenever Make gets a signal from Notion, it'll automatically share your content on LinkedIn.
### Set up in Notion
Remember that webhook URL from Make? You'll need it for the next part. Let's set up your automation in Notion:
- Open your social media database and click the lightning bolt () icon in the top right
- ClickNew automationto get started

##########################################

- Set up your triggerchoose "Status" and "approved" so your automation runs whenever a post is marked as approved
- In the "do" section, pick "Send webhook" from the dropdown
- Paste your Make webhook URL into the URL field
- Select the properties you want to sendin this case, "Final Copy"
Voil! Now whenever you mark a post asApproved, Notion will automatically share the text from theFinal Copyproperty and tell Make to post it on LinkedIn.

##########################################

## Go further with buttons and webhook actions to automate your workflows
Buttons are an easy way to streamline your workflow and trigger automations with just a few clicks. Here are two practical ways you can use buttons with webhook actions:
- Use buttons to directly post social media contentAs a content reviewer, you can proofread the final copy of a blog post before sharing it on platforms like "X" or "Threads". By adding a button to your social media post's review page, you can automatically publish the content with one click  just use the same setup from above!

##########################################

- Use buttons to automate support ticketsLet's say you manage a database tracking issues from your team, while your engineering team handles fixes in a different tool, like Zendesk. By adding a button to your bug reports page, you can automatically create a ticket in Zendesk and get a confirmation email right away. This streamlined process lets you notify your support team without having to switch toolsall from within Notion.
Webhook actions open up so many possibilities-- from setting up workflows that save you time to keeping everyone in the loop across different tools. Start small with something simple, then build from there as you get the hang of it. The goal is to make your work flow more smoothly, one automation at a time.

##########################################

# Sharing & permissions
- Permissions in Notion ensure that everyone in a workspace has the right level of access to information.
- In a Notion workspace, one can either be aworkspace owner,membership admin,member, andguest. These roles can control workspace settings and membership additions.
- Teamspace roles exist separately from workspace roles, withteamspace ownersandteamspace membershaving different levels of access.
- Permissions can be set to various levels, fromFull AccesstoCan View, to control access to pages.
- Teamspacesettings can be set toDefault,Open,Closed, orPrivate, affecting workspace members' ability to join and see the teamspace.
- The Notion sidebar contains theTeamspaces,Shared, andPrivatesections to organize information.
- Pages can be shared with specific individuals, teamspaces, or everyone, and can also bepublished to the web.

##########################################



##########################################

# A simple CRM for strengthening client relationships and managing work
You need a simple, flexible CRM, so instead of spending time updating spreadsheets, you can focus on delivering successful campaigns and projects for your clients.
Traditional CRMs often overcomplicate your workflow with unnecessary features and rigid processes.
But, in Notion, you can build a custom CRM that matches how you workandincludes everything you needfrom client details and portals to project management and revenue tracking.
## An at-a-glance view of all your client information
Notion databases provide a structured home for growing sets of data, like your client list.

##########################################

For every new prospect or client, youll create a new entry and usedatabase propertiesto assign information and categorize items in helpful ways.
### To get started:
1. Create a scannable table for client details
On a new page in your workspace, create a full-page database with aTablelayout. This will display all your client information at a glance, in a scannable format thats quick to update.
Next, add some properties to categorize client information across the board. For example, use aPersonproperty to assign an account manager or owner from your team, aTextproperty to note your client point of contact, andEmailandPhoneproperties to store contact information.

##########################################

You can also classify entries in your database with useful custom tags. UsingSelectorMulti-selectproperties, categorize your clients by industry, company size, and lead source.
### 2. Manage client journey through the pipeline
Your client database is more than just a repository of information, you can use it to track leads and prospects as they move through your pipeline to become active clients.
To do this, add aStatusproperty to your database and customize the labels to reflect each step of your funnel (Lead, Prospect, Active, etc).

##########################################

Then, you can move clients across a Kanban-style board to update their status. Create an additionalBoardview of your database, andGroupthe board byStatus. Now you can drag and drop clients to move them from Prospect to Lead, or Active to Inactive.
### 3. Reshuffle information in different, helpful ways
Sort,Filter, andGroupare powerful tools to slice client information in useful ways.
For example, you might want to:
- View all currently active clients Add a new database view and apply a filter so that only clients marked as active will show up in the table.
- Organize clients by industry or size To understand more about your core client base, use Group to arrange your client database by industry, size, or any other category.

##########################################

- Sort your clients by lead source Sorting your database according to lead source could help you analyze where most of your high-quality leads are coming from, which in turn will inform your marketing efforts.
- Display revenue on aChart Use aNumberproperty to record each client's revenue or potential deal size. Then, you can create aChartdatabase view to visualize your monthly, quarterly, or annual revenue, split by client.
Unlike a spreadsheet or document, Notion databases let you categorize and group information however you like, so you can quickly glean insights about your client base.

##########################################

## Invite your clients to a custom home page
Notion client portals are a central hub for contracts, agreements, reference materials, task trackers, and more, helping your team and clients stay aligned.
Clients get visibility into ongoing projects and can give instant feedback, and team members can collaborate, share information, and make progress without blockers.
Every database entry opens up as its own, fully customizable page. So, to streamline your workflow, build client portals directly in the pages of your client database.
### Create homepages in the client database
Whenever you add a new client to your database, open up the database entry and start building a workspace to share with your clients.

##########################################

When your portal is ready, go to theSharemenu, type in your client email addresses, select a permission level from the drop-down, and clickInvite.

##########################################

Use client portals to:
- Familiarize clients with your company A brief introduction to explain your company mission and values helps new clients understand how youll work together. You might also include contact details, and procedures for booking meetings or requesting changes and updates. You can usesynced blocksto keep this information accurate and up to date.
- Kick off the onboarding process Include all the materials you want clients to go through in the onboarding phase. Here, you might haveformsfor clients to fill out, and requirements for getting started.
- Keep contracts, agreements, and documents organized Instead of having documents scattered across folders, keep your invoices, contracts, and agreements together in the client portal. You can create documents as sub-pages, or embed PDFs or Google docs directly into Notion.
- Help team members stay on track with work Put a project or task tracker inside the client portal to make sure team members know what to do, and clients can see what youre working on. You could use anInlinedatabase to track work, or just a simpleTo-do listwhere you tag team members using the@command.
- Document strategy and goals Strategize and record goals and KPIs in your client portal, to keep everyone on the same page and working towards a common objective.
- Store relevant meeting notes Take note of all client conversations with a database in the portal. Create a new entry every time you have a call or meeting to record what was said, next steps, and action items to address.

##########################################

Database templates can help standardize your work and onboard clients faster. You can create a client portal template that youll fill up for each new client, so you dont have to start from a blank page every time.
To do this, add a New Client template to the database, and populate the page with an outline of what you want your client portal to include. For example, insert your company bio and contact information, a checklist or database for tasks, a place to store notes and headings for things like resources, proposals, guidelines, and goals.

##########################################

Now, whenever you add a new client to your database, use the template. Youll have an outline of your client portal ready to go, and all you have to do is complete the information and attach relevant files.
### 2. Invite clients to the portal as guests
Once youve created the portal, you need to invite your clients as guests to your workspace so they can access the content.
When you invite external collaborators to your workspace, you have full control over what pages they can access, so you can make sure they see everything they need, and nothing more.

##########################################

When youre ready to share the portal, go to theSharemenu at the top of the page and type in their email addresses. You might give clients full access to the page, but, in most cases, youll want to give them permission to view and comment, but not edit.
Clients will have access to the client portal page, as well as any sub-pages nested in it.
Learn more about sharing and permissions settingshere.
### 3. Collaborate effortlessly
Instead of trying to keep up with conversations on several different channels, streamline communication by communicating with clients directly in your client portal.

##########################################

Clients can give feedback and make requests directly in the place where youre doing the work, creating faster feedback loops and less chance of you missing an important message.
Comments can be left at the top of any Notion page, or on a specific block within the page. You can tag team members or guests in a comment using the@command and typing their names.
Clients can request changes to a document, and you can assign tasks to a team member or ask a manager to review work with a comment.
With all communication in Notion, your team and clients can work faster with full visibility and reduce the friction of collaborating with clients.

##########################################

## A scalable, customizable system
What starts as a basic CRM can be customized as your team grows and processes evolve. You can incorporate different aspects of you work. company knowledge and project management.
Connect clients to projects, meetings, and company knowledge for a comprehensive, connected system that keeps all your work in one place.

##########################################

- Draft docs faster with AI You can outline and draft proposals, creative briefs, and campaign plans much faster using Notion AI to write, edit, and refine your content.
- Surface insights from across the workspace With Notions AI assistant, you can ask natural language questions about any content in your workspace and get an immediate answer.
- Reduce manual work with automations Database automations reduce the manual work of updating your CRM. For example, you can use database automations to notify team members by Slack or email when a client goes live.
- Centralize your company information in a homepage On a top-level workspace page, create a company homepage where team members can access all the internal resources and documentation about your company, with quick links to client pages and ongoing work.

# The best ways to use simple tables in your Notion pages (and when not to)
Simple tables leave you to do what you do best  think. There are times that a database, with so much functionality, can feel like a power drill when a screwdriver would actually make doing the job easier.
Simple tables let you create columns and rows. Display important text. Add headers. And thats just about it. Because sometimes, thats all you need.
Here well walk you through a few use cases for simple tables and discuss scenarios in which you might be better off with a database.

##########################################

## When to use simple tables
Simple tables make yournotesanddocumentationricher and easier to read. They let you display plain text visually to help get your point across to readers (or your future self) in a clear and efficient manner. Just like callouts draw attention to text and bullets are used to parse info, simple tables are great for collecting and organizing bits of related information.
To add a simple table to your page:
- Type/tableand select the first option.
- Drag outwards to add additional columns, or down to add additional rows.
Once your simple table is created  just click into cells, and use thetabkey to navigate horizontally as you add content.

##########################################

### Display information clearly and concisely
When you're looking to distill information in an easy-to-read format, try simple tables. In these instances, databases can feel overwhelming to the reader and the depth of information structure doesn't provide an additional benefit. For example, if youre reporting metrics in a meeting, you can use a simple table to focus on the data at hand.
- Label information with headers use theOptionsmenu to toggle on row and column headers for additional visual distinction in the form of a colored header background and bolded header text.
- Display side-by-side with other blocks when context is needed for whats inside a simple table, drag and drop it next to any other block type in Notion.

##########################################

How to organize your meeting notes

### Draw attention to important concepts
Similarly, you may want to use simple tables in team documentation to emphasize key pieces of information. It can be easier to digest for the reader than other basic blocks, especially when several pieces of information are related.

##########################################

For example, in the case of data reporting you could consider including data definitions for important metrics. Here you could follow the same flow to add a simple table  toggle on the column header option, and start adding content! Simple tables in documentation don't have to be stagnant. Here are just a few features to help keep your work dynamic:
- Add and insert rows and columns if at any point you need to insert content, like a new definition, use the row and column handles to add above, below, right, or left!
- Maximize space on the page use theoption to snap your database to page or column width and further draw reader's attention to the information. This is especially helpful after you've added a column, to reset the width of your whole table.

##########################################

In both of these use cases, we're just dealing with displaying and reporting information, without the need to further organize, tag, or calculate anything. That's a good way to think about simple tables in general  just the text, none of the fancy stuff.
### Brainstorm without committing to database structure
In addition to making documents and notes richer, simple tables can be good for ideation before committing to a full database structure. This is great when you want the flexibility to quickly iterate in a discussion or brainstorm, and sets you up to easily convert your information to a database later on.

##########################################

Let's consider the example of planning an offsite for your team  throughout the day you'll have lots of different sessions, speakers, etc. In the long run, this will be a great use case for a database, but when you want to put pen to paper, a simple table is best and here's why:
- Collaborate with inline comments since simple tables just store plain text, all of Notion's collaboration tools, including inline comments, will work as expected. You can mention team members and have full discussions, right on your main page.

##########################################

- Drag and drop rows and columns as needed the flexible text structure means that you can easily move columns around in a way that makes sense to you and your team. For offsite planning, use this to arrange sessions in order after you've brainstormed.
- Delete rows that are no longer needed plans change, and in the startup world they change quickly. Easily remove the contents of a row using the row handle.

##########################################

## Databases add organization and depth
Think of simple tables like the collection of post-it notes in your home office  informative for small bits of information, and eye catching  but they don't scale. Simple tables are to post-it notes as databases are to bullet journals and nicely bound planners. Use databases for yourprojectsandtasks, or asrepositoriesfor big collections of notes & docs.
### When to convert a simple table to a database
While simple tables let you quickly visualize information, you should consider converting to a database anytime you are wanting to filter or sort through said information. To do this, use theTurn into Databaseoption in the table menu.

##########################################

In the case of our offsite planning example, you may consider converting your table to a database once all parties have signed off on the schedule, and you're ready to use pages in a database to plan sessions. This will give you tons of additional functionality, including:
- Add date properties to map the day on a timeline databases can have multiple views, which means you can display them in different ways  including on a timeline or calendar.

##########################################

- Open rows to a full page to add speaker notes and details unlike simple tables, database rows can open to new Notion pages where you can store important information related to the topic of the row.
- Add additional properties for task management your events have a speaker, room assignment, and a lot more. Add properties to keep track of these details.
- Sort and filter events once your properties are in place, filter based on the person assigned for facilitation, or sort by time and date.

##########################################

Generally speaking, databases are differentiated in that they allow you to open each entry as it's own page, add functional tags (dates, people, URL, and more), create relationships, rollups, and formulas, and display data in different views (lists, timelines, calendars, boards, and galleries).

### When to start with a database
We've got tons of resources detailing database use cases, but generally speaking it's a good idea to skip the simple table altogether when you need to capture multiple, categorical pieces of information about each item, like asales CRM.

##########################################

If you're hoping to create integrations  like with Slack or any 3rd party no-code tool, databases are a better option from the get-go. In the case of the CRM, here's an exampleintegration that automatically adds rows to your database when your team creates a new contact in salesforce. While we won't go into additional detail on these features here, it should be clear that they're the more exhaustive option.
Here are some of Notion's favorite database use cases
- Meeting notes
- Docs
- Roadmap
- Sales CRM
- Employee directory

##########################################

The larger your tool system gets, the more likely it will look like a database. Until then, get started quickly and elegantly with simple tables  and in case you're just looking to produce a beautiful document, simple tables will always be in your toolbox.

##########################################

# Start fresh and do the thing: How to actually set and hit team goals this year
Much like setting personal resolutions, achieving your teams goals is all about creating a system  one that makes it super clear which projects help achieve those goals. High-output teams often get so heads down in execution that they lose sight of the bigger picture.
In Notion, you can develop a system that breaks down goals into actionable projects. These projects all get owners and deadlines, but theres also clarity about which goals they support, both company- and team-wide.
Because planning and execution live side-by-side, Notion can give your team actionable granularity with important perspective.

##########################################

## Using this setup, youll soon have a goals tracker that looks like this:
Clearly see how team goals roll up into company goals
Having this context is like putting a pair of glasses on your team  it brings everything into focus, helping you prioritize and execute with transparency.
Normally, company goals are buried in a document somewhere, separate from the work your team is doing. Notion unites company goals, team goals, and the work that supports them, centralizing your most vital information.
Heres how we think about it: projects  initiatives  team goals  company goals.
After establishing both company and team goals, we suggest making two databases: one for your teams roadmap and another for the projects thatll accomplish those goals.

##########################################

Heres how:
- Create aTablethats for your teams initiatives (this can be a page in yourteam's wiki). Call it Roadmap.
- Create a column called Company Goals using aMulti-selectproperty, where each is a company goal. Do the same thing but this time, with Team Goals.
- Every row in the table will be its own initiative, each correlating to both company and team goals. For example, if your company goal is to increase revenue, your team goal could be to acquire more leads. The initiative might be to establish a referral program.
- Assign each of your initiatives a company goal and a team goal. This creates a line of sight from your teams work all the way to the companys goals.

##########################################

- Now create a secondTable. This will be for your teams projects, so call it Projects.
- Think about which specific projects can help accomplish these larger initiatives. For your initiative of establishing a referral program, projects might include: new email designs, creating an incentive structure, and establishing baseline metrics for success. Make each row in the table its own project.
- Now youre going to connect these two databases  so you can see all your goals, initiatives, and projects together. In your Roadmap, create a newRelationproperty. Locate your Projects database. Now you can begin assigning projects to the initiatives they support.

##########################################

Whenever you create a new project, simply add it to your Projects database  where you can assign it an initiative. That way, itll automatically show up in your Roadmap too, so everything your team needs is in one place.
## Assign owners and timelines to set your plan in motion
Actionable work has clear owners and timelines. When teams jump between calendar apps, project management and work tools, things slip through the cracks. With Notion, your team can see everything in one place, putting the focus on execution.
Properties help organize all the work youre doing. Heres how you can use them in each of your databases:
In your Roadmap:

##########################################

- Add aPersonproperty and assign an owner for each initiative.
- You can add aSelectproperty to assign a priority to all the goals. That way, you can prioritize whats most important first.
- Use anotherSelectproperty to assign statuses to your goals, like Blocked, or In progress, or Punted.
- So you can see whats happening each quarter, createMulti-selectproperties (Q1, Q2, etc.). Because initiatives are bigger than projects, they may span multiple quarters.

##########################################

In your Projects:
- Add aPersonproperty and call it DRI (directly responsible individual), assigning one person to each project. You can also create a secondPersonproperty where you can tag anyone who the DRI is working with on that project.
- With aDateproperty, you can designate a target launch date for each project. You can get even more granular by assigning each project an execution timeline. Add anotherDateproperty and this time, toggle onEnd date.
- Use aSelectproperty for the status of your project. These can be things like Not started, Planning, or Done.
- You can further categorize your projects using anotherSelectproperty to assign a Type to each one. These can be things like Launch, Email campaign, or Team-building.

##########################################

Having these properties in each of your tables gives you an instant download of what your team is working on  and everyone has clarity into what each other is working on. Goals give that high-level look. Projects get a little more granular. And because both are connected, you get a full line of sight across your entire organization  timelines, owners, and the goals youre working toward. This is great for building a culture of transparency and self-serve information.

##########################################

## Create custom database views that surface relevant information
Setting a yearly plan can feel a bit intimidating. But custom views of your Roadmap and Projects databases give you the ability to bucket this information  whether thats projects youre working on this week or initiatives for the entire quarter.
Custom database views allow your team to focus on whats important now, while maintaining that broader level of transparency for bigger initiatives or team-wide goals.

##########################################

Here are some views for your Roadmap:
- A filtered view for each person on your team, so they can see all the initiatives theyre responsible for (and the related projects) in one place. This is especially helpful for reviews or planning sessions.
- ABoardthat organizes all your projects by status, so you can see whats in-flight  or if anything is blocked.
- Tableviews for each quarter, so you can see all the goals, initiatives, and projects and when theyre being executed, like Q1 Roadmap through Q4 Roadmap.

##########################################

And some views for your Projects:
- ABoardthatsGrouped bythe DRI, so you can see how many projects each person on your team is responsible for.
- If your team has sub-teams  like the content team or the product marketing team  create views just for them, filtered to only see their projects.
- ATimelineview to see the execution scope for projects. After youve made the timeline view, hit thebutton on the top right, and selectTimeline by. This will give you the option to choose which date youd like to organize your timeline by  which will be your project timeline property (not deadlines).
- ACalendarof all your launch deadlines, so you can see whats set to launch whenever.

##########################################

## Use database templates to establish consistency
In your Projects database, templates can help ensure youre approaching projects with the same set of criteria and process every time.
Launches, design specs, growth projects  they can all have their own templates with unique requirements so teams arent re-inventing the wheel every time they start a project. This streamlines your process and puts the focus on execution, allowing everyone to move forward with confidence, knowing edge cases are accounted for.

##########################################

Remember: any item in a Notion database is a page that can be modified any way you want. Templates give you the structure to establish a repeatable process or surface common needs, but these pages are also customizable, flexible enough to be anything your team needs to accomplish their work.
To make a template in your Projects database, hit the bluevarrow next toNewon the top right corner. Then select+ New template.
Another great thing about templates? They can be updated whenever. If you learn something new or uncover a better process, update your template and take those learnings forward.

##########################################

## Keep goals top of mind with linked databases
When goals are visible, all work gets put into perspective. If you ever wonder about taking on an initiative, think: Does this roll up into my teams goals?
Same goes for reviews. Whether its weekly, monthly, or quarterly, conducting consistent reviews helps your team assess their work and improve going forward.

##########################################

Using Notion, you can link to your Roadmap or Projects databases with specific views relevant to certain pages. For example:
- In your weekly 1:1s with direct reports, link a view of the Projects database showing only their projects for the quarter. Put this in your 1:1 template so its included automatically every week. This is really useful for check-ins, questions, prioritization, and status updates on the reports work. And if you mark a project as complete, its reflected in your master Projects database.

##########################################

- If youre hosting quarterly reviews, you can link a view of the Roadmap so everyone can see whats been accomplished that quarter. These reviews help shape your planning, with that hindsight providing invaluable foresight.
- Align cross-functional teams. If your marketing team constantly collaborates with your sales team, you can create a view of the marketing Roadmap just for sales that lives in their wiki  so they can see all work relevant to them.
- In your team wiki (or company wiki!), its helpful to see all the work in motion for a specific week. This promotes transparency. Link a view of your Projects database at the top of your wiki, filtered by launch date  so no one misses anything important.

##########################################

## Plan with clarity, execute with confidence
Setting clear goals puts your teams work into focus. Its easy to get off track and lose that focus  but this system maintains the thread between the day-to-day and the big things you want to accomplish.
Its also extremely flexible, for when, inevitably, things come up along the way. As targets move, goals shift, and priorities change, you and your team will be ready.
Whether its the beginning of the year or the start of a new quarter, planning is a great time to rally your team around goals and how to accomplish them. Notion brings your team together to do this in one place.

# The status property gives you clarity on task progress
Notion databases now have a purpose-built status property for assigning status to your projects or tasks. For every project, you get a clear view of what needs to be done, whats completed, and whats dependent on another task being completed first.
Choose from one of three categories: To Do, In Progress, or Complete, and create as many sub-categories as you need. In this guide, well show you how project managers can design a custom workflow with enough constraints to maintain clarity without sacrificing meaningful definitions that make life easier for you and your team.

##########################################

When multiple people are working on a project, you need standard status definitions to keep everyone on the same page. If you have too many similar categories, different categories on different projects, and crossover between those categories, its hard to understand whats actually going on.
If everyone's using their own definitions, you lose accuracy. You have to spend time deciphering the difference between a project thats "In Progress" versus one thats "Started." And what about that project tagged Waiting? Does that mean waiting to start, or is it dependent on another project?

##########################################

Notion's dedicated status property can help clear up this confusion and make it easier to set up a standardized system for your team. In a few clicks, project managers can set up an easy way to see where everyones at with ongoing work. All your projects will fall into one of three overarching categories: To Do, In Progress, or Complete, and you can create custom sub-categories to give more context and specifics.

##########################################

## A ready-to-use, customizable workflow
As a project manager, you dont have time to deliberate over the details of the projects database. In Notion you can create a functional projects database from scratch and have it up and running in just a few clicks. Add properties to record the most important information, and customize the database as needed.
The status property comes pre-loaded with the three most important tags. You can then customize as you go to add details that will help you manage your teams work more effectively.
## The status property helps managers keep projects on track
When it comes to project status, creating a standard set of options up front can make the true status of projects clearer.

##########################################

Until this point, most Notion users have been using aSelectproperty to create different project status options. They may have usedMulti-selectto give more specific information, so you could tag a project as both "In Progress" and "Waiting for Update."
The problem here is that anyone can just type in a whole new category, without knowing that a similar one already exists. It quickly gets confusing when everyone has too much freedom, and therefore room for inconsistency.

##########################################

Its time-consuming to create categories unnecessarily, over and over again, and overlapping categories can be open to interpretation. Plus, filtering the database is trickier, as you need multiple filters to include all the definitions. If you miss one, your view of a projects status is compromised.
The status property gives you more constraints, less confusion.
In a few steps, you can set up a simple project workflow for your team. You can get granular by creating multiple tags to label the various stages to take a project from In Progress to Complete.
You wont lose sight of the bigger picture, as youll know exactly how many projects are underway, whats in the pipeline, and which ones are done and dusted.

##########################################

## How to use the status property in your projects database
To add a status property to your projects database, simply follow the steps below:
- Go to your projects database.
- Click on thefor database options.
- Go toPropertiesthen click+ New property.
- InType, selectStatus.
- To add your own custom status tags, selectAdd statusunderneath To-do, In Progress or Completed, and type in your new sub-category. You cant change the three main categories.
- You can choose whether you want to display the status like a select property, or as a checkbox. The checkbox will show everything in "To Do" as unchecked.

##########################################

### The status property comes pre-loaded with common categories, but you might find it useful to add your own sub-categories, such as:
To Do
- In the Pipeline  an idea or proposal that may go ahead in the future, but is not a priority.
- Up next   Prioritize projects in your backlog.
- Blocked  the project can't go ahead until a problem is fixed.
- In review  when youre waiting for sign-off so the project should start.
### In Progress
- 1st Draft, 2nd Draft, Editing  the different stages of creating a piece of content.
- With (team member)  this shows you who's currently working on the project.
- Waiting  a project that cant progress until you get approval or further information.

##########################################

### Complete
- Ready to Publish  lets you know that the project is ready to finalize.
- Published  for all projects that have gone live.
## A more intuitive way to filter and group your database by status
Filtering databases is the best way to view contextual information and avoid overwhelm. The status property makes filtering your projects database easier and more efficient than ever.
To create a database view showing all projects that are currently in progress:
- Go to your database, and selectAdd view.
- Give your view a name, such asIn Progress.
- In your new view, clickFilter, and choose the status property.
- Filter by StatusIn Progress.
Now, you have a database view showing all your ongoing projects.

##########################################

You can also create a board grouping all your In Progress projects by their sub-category.
- Create a new database view. This time, selectBoard.
- Filter the database by Status and selectIn Progressjust like before.
- Go to options, (...) selectGroup,Group by, and choose Status. Then clickSortand selectManualto be able to drag your categories into the desired order.
- You can toggle onHide empty groupsto keep the database view looking neat.
And there you have it  a board, filtered to show all ongoing projects, grouped by their status sub-category. You can easily see how many projects are near to completion, and which ones still have a way to go before theyre wrapped up.

Teamspaces give everyone a place to get work done, and make it easier to find relevant information. For example, you can get straight to where the docs, notes and databases related to engineering live, without getting caught up in another teams work along the way. Whats more, you can customize which teamspaces and pages show up in your sidebar, and where, so that its perfectly suited to your working needs.
When youre able to find what you need, you can settle in faster and accomplish great work every day.

##########################################

Teamspaces are sections of the workspace where youll collaborate with your team and share relevant information and ideas. They help keep your Notion sidebar organized, so youll spend less time digging through disorganized files and untitled pages, and more time focussing on what matters.
This guide will be your introduction to teamspaces and how they work.

##########################################

## Join teamspaces to connect and collaborate with your teammates
You can join teamspaces for teams, offices, cross-functional projects - even common interest groups! Once youve joined these teamspaces, their documents will always be easy to access. Theres no limit to how many teamspaces you can join, but, to maintain a clean workspace, only join teamspaces that are useful in your day to day work.
You can view information in some teamspaces without joining, and synced blocks can be helpful when you need to pull a small piece of information across teamspaces.

##########################################

Here are some examples of teamspaces youll join:
- The whole company Everyone in the organization will belong to one teamspace, by default, which might be called something like General. This is where youll find company-wide information such as benefits information, vacation policy, mission, vision, values, and more.
- Your department Whether you work in marketing, engineering or sales, youll join a teamspace for that department where you can collaborate with your teammates and find information that relates to your everyday work. This will be the area of the company workspace where you spend most of your time.
- Current projects Collaborating with a cross-functional group on a feature launch, a marketing campaign or a website redesign? The project lead might create a teamspace where everyone involved in that project - engineers, designers, marketers and managers - can come to find information about the project, and actually do the work thats required. These teamspaces may be archived once the project is over, so they wont clutter up the workspace, but the content will always be there for reference.
- Your office Its helpful to have a place to connect with the teammates you share an office with, even if you all have diverse roles in the company. The teamspace for the London office might contain information thats specific to that location -  local holidays, guest protocol, meeting room calendar, etc.
- Employee resource and interest groups  Connect with fellow LGBTQ @ your company, Women @ your company, or other affinity groups through teamspaces. Plus, if youre joining the company book club or fantasy baseball league, you might find all the resources related to your hobby stored in a dedicated teamspace. Not only does this help you find and share relevant information, but it also keeps it separate from your daily workload.

##########################################

To browse all existing teamspaces, just go toAll teamspacesin your sidebar menu. All the teamspaces youre currently a member of will show up underYour teamspacesand others will appear underMore teamspaces.

##########################################

There are three types of teamspaces:
- Open Anyone can join an open teamspace, and you can view the content even if you arent a member. To join, all you have to do is hover over the teamspace and clickJoin. Alternatively, if youre viewing a page in an open teamspace, clicking on the teamspace name in the breadcrumb will give you the option to join.
- Closed Teamspaces that are set to closed will appear in your sidebar underMore teamspacesand theyll show up with an open padlock next to their name. You wont be able to join unless a team owner invites you - they can do this in the teamspace settings & members menu.
- Private You wont see private teamspaces unless youre a member of that teamspace. A teamspace might be private because it relates to sensitive information, for example, the People team might use a private teamspace to collect employee feedback.

##########################################

## Arrange your sidebar to prioritize pages you use most
Speed up your navigation in Notion by customizing your sidebar. Keep pages you visit frequently in your favorites, and arrange your teamspaces according to how frequently you access their content.
### Here are a few tips for organizing your sidebar:
1. Arrange your teamspaces according to what you use most
Youll probably start your day in your departments teamspace, so you can keep it at the top of the list with its toggle open. You can keep this teamspace toggle open, so that its always easy to dive straight into the page you need.
The same goes for teamspaces for project-specific, cross-functional teams you form a part of.

##########################################

Some teamspaces, like General, you might not need to access as frequently. Collapse those teamspaces toggles and move them farther down the list in your sidebar, so they arent getting in the way of daily navigation.
### 2. Favorite pages you visit every day
You can use the star icon at the top of any page to pin it to your sidebar.
Regardless of which teamspace the page lives in, pages that you pin will appear at the top of your sidebar under Favorites. We recommend adding just a handful of pages to your favorites, to avoid having too many scattered pages in the sidebar where you cant see the teamspace they belong to.

##########################################

### 3. Use shared pages like 1:1 notes for easy access
You can still create private and shared pages in your workspace if you only need to give access to a few people, for example, the notes from your 1:1 meetings with your line manager.
These shared pages are easy to find - theyre filed underSharedin your side bar.
## Stay in the loop across teamspaces with synced blocks
With synced blocks, you can copy over any Notion block from one place to another. Any time you make a change to the information in one place, it will update everywhere.

##########################################

This makes it simple to keep information updated across teamspaces, and have those updates automatically distributed. By avoiding having to copy and paste information each time, you can reduce work and ensure information is kept accurate in all locations.
In open teamspaces, you can create synced blocks so that the same information can appear in two or more places at once.

##########################################

For example:
- Dont miss important company-wide announcements Updates that affect the whole company might be created in the General teamspace. Put a synced copy of the announcements block in your teams weekly meeting notes, and youll always be on top of the most recent updates.
- Make project work visible everywhere For your cross-functional projects, synced blocks provide transparency for your team and manager into what youre working on - even if the work youre doing is in a different teamspace. Add them to your 1:1 docs, your personal tasks homepage, or your weekly team standup doc.
- View top-level goals that impact your work Company goals that live in the General teamspace might be particularly relevant to a project or goal your team is currently working towards. Bring those company goals into your teams project area with a synced block, so you always keep the why of what youre doing top of mind.

##########################################

## Teamspaces give you another way to find and filter information
Search is a useful tool for finding any page, but if your search brings up the entire companys documents, it can take a while to scan through all those pages. Filtering by teamspace can help you cut through to what youre looking for quickly.

##########################################

To search for a page, click Search at the top of the sidebar, and start typing out the name of the page youre looking for (or any words or phrases in the page content.) To filter your results by teamspace:
- Click Show filters to bring up the filter menu
- Choose criteria to filter by. Youll the option to filter by teamspace
- When youve selected the relevant teamspace, youll see that your search results are filtered to only include pages belonging to that teamspace.
You can also select Ask AI to use Notion AI to search for content.

# Switch from Confluence to Notion with our easy importer
If youve been dreaming of Confluence alternatives, you might feel likeBranch.ioCo-founder Dmitri Gaskin:
In Confluence, our documentation was spread over a number of different spaces and hard to find. With Notion, its all in one place as a single source of truth.
When documentation is inaccessible, its unusable. Think about all the documentation in your wiki thats core to your company and its workflows  your mission, processes, decision logs, meeting notes, and so much more. All that is too important to be trapped in a tool no one wants to use.

##########################################

Now, you can easily move your entire Confluence workspace over to Notion. This turns your wiki into a single tool that unites your project management system, notes, and shared docs.
The result: time saved, greater transparency and alignment, and more productivity  all while you pay for fewer tools.
## A functional wiki empowers your team
Rigid wiki software turns vital information into a knot of documents no one at your company can untangle.
Our Confluence wiki was a mess. Different teams would update different things. No one knew what was usable, says Mixpanel Engineering Manager Vijay Iyengar.

##########################################

Notion combines the flexibility to update information that specific teams crave with the structure managers, HR and people ops teams need to maintain consistency.

##########################################

With Notion, you can:
- Build pages and edit information easily for non-technical teams, creating pages in Confluence can be intimidating and time-consuming. Notions user-friendly interface makes it easy for more teams and individuals to contribute and communicate.
- Connect all your work seamlessly don't just link out to your work in scattered, siloed apps. Notion puts it all in the same place. Your documents can live next to project specs, within one click of benefits and your product roadmap. Easy access, team-wide transparency.
- Create custom workflows software shouldn't shape the way you work. Notion is malleable enough to fit any process (even workflows custom to only your team), whether its a project-specific Kanban board or customizable templates used for recurring projects.

##########################################

When a wiki functions as both a home to information and a place to get work done every day, it becomes the singular hub for just about anything your employees need. Everyone can go faster, with more information, and more connection to one another.
## How to use Notions Confluence importer
Move your entire workspace over to Notion without missing a beat. In just a few clicks, you wont only have a more powerful wiki  youll have access to tools that enable connected, streamlined workflows.

##########################################

### Export your Confluence wiki
In order to move your workspace over to Notion, youll first need to get it out of Confluence. Heres how:
- In your Confluence workspace, go toSpace Settingson the sidebar.
- SelectContent Tools, then hitExporton the toolbar below.
- ChooseHTMLfrom the format options. Youll then be presented with export HTML options. ClickCustom Export.
- Select which pages you want to export from Confluence and import to Notion. Keep in mind that pages with large attachments can increase export size and complexity!
- Allow your export to finish processing. This could take some time. Grab a snack.
- After the export is complete, clickDownload hereto save the export to your computer. Youll get a zip file that contains the HTML version of the pages you selected.

##########################################

If you dont see these options, you might need to request permission to export from your workspace admin.
### Import your workspace into Notion
It takes about three clicks to get your entire Confluence workspace into Notion. They are:
- Hit theImportbutton in your sidebar (on the bottom left).
- SelectConfluencefrom the button menu.
- Find the zip file containing your exported Confluence workspace and select it to be uploaded. Dont worry about unzipping the file! Just upload the entire archive. Give it a few minutes for the upload to complete.
Thats it! Welcome to your new Notion wiki.
## Tips for using your Notion wiki
Now that your wiki is in Notion, here are some of the features you can use to make it shine.

##########################################

### Create new pages in a flash
Instead of worrying about parent and child pages, or previews and publishing, you can instantly create new pages in Notion that add to your companys collective knowledge.

##########################################

There are two ways to make a page:
- From the sidebar hover overWORKSPACEand hit the+sign to create a new top-level page in your workspace everyone has access to (same goes for adding a page to yourPRIVATEsection, where only you have access). Each team can have one of these top-level pages, like one for sales and one for marketing.
- When youre already inside a page hit/to bring up a whole menu of options for things you can do in a Notion page (we call this the slash command). Type/pageand selectPageto make a new sub-page in a flash, and know its in the right place with automatic page hierarchies.

##########################################

### Tailor pages to your needs
Pages in Notion are totally customizable. This flexibility allows teams to create pages that match their specific needs  whether thats engineers adding code blocks, designers adding Figma files, or product teams including audio from a customer research interview.
Here are a few tools you can use to customize the Notion pages thatll be in your wiki:
- Embed just about anything type/and the name of what you want to embed into a Notion page, like/codeor/video. This adds important texture, allowing teams to build unique Notion pages based on the work at hand.

##########################################

- Drag-and-drop for ultimate flexibility the ability to move pages around your wiki helps keep everything organized. Grab theicon to drag-and-drop anything in your wiki, like including photos next to text or re-arranging pages under a specific header. You can even create columns. Drag a page or header all the way to the right and blue lines will help guide you.
- Page covers and icons imbue every page with your brand add a bit of flair and visual recognition to your pages with custom icons and page covers. These let you create a branded experience everywhere, instead of all pages that are one note.
### Quickly find what you need
Half of a wiki's utility comes from being able to easily find what you need.

##########################################

Notion gives you two ways to surface that info, either from the sidebar or searching your entire workspace.
- See all pages from your sidebar in any top-level page in the sidebar, hit the>arrow to see all the sub-pages inside that page. You can go as deep as youd like by hitting the arrow next to any sub-page to see all its sub-pages.
- Search everything in your workspace quickly access anything you need by typingcmd/ctrl+p. This brings up Notions search function. For example, you can type dental benefits to find the page that contains that information. You can even filter based on things like pages only edited within the last week or pages you created.

##########################################

### Anyone can make unique workflows
Your wiki holds the information your team needs to work. But when it comes time to execute? Theyre probably leaving the wiki and opening another app.
Notion unites these two work streams, putting information alongside execution.

##########################################

This allows any individual or team to build custom workflows for the task at hand. Here are a few suggestions from our team:
- Include your company roadmap or projects right in your wiki if your team is running projects on Notion, you can link your roadmap right at the top of your wiki. Whys this useful? It keeps everyone on the same page and makes all work transparent. You can even create a custom view thats just this weeks launches. And all the information about those launches is centrally accessible to teams or company-wide.

##########################################

- Use databases for any workflow you need Notion has many different types of databases that are modifiable to fit your teams needs, like tables, lists, galleries, Gantt charts, etc. Your roadmap might be a table. Meeting notes could be a list. Sprints can use a Gantt chart (we call it a Timeline since it's a bit more powerful). Learn all about themhere.
- See how all your information is connected backlinks in Notion show where else a page is referenced. This creates a rich graph of all your information, showing you where pages are linked, and maybe more importantly, where they need to be linked. Read up on backlinkshere.

# Synced Databases bridge the gap between different tools
Synced Databases give you the power to bring information from different sources into Notion. You can create a single source of truth to unite your team by syncing Jira boards, Jira projects, GitHub PRs and GitHub issues as Notion databases.
When you oversee projects involving different teams, its challenging to make sure everyones on the same page, working with the latest version of events. Teams often rely on several tools to get work done, so you need a robust system to bring everything together and bridge the gap between the specialized tools your teams use, and the system to track and manage the work, where collaboration happens.

##########################################

Sometimes, when teams are using different tools, important information about their work can stay in those tools, hidden from other teams and project managers. By created Synced Databases with GitHub and Jira, you can bring information from those tools into Notion, which provides clarity for everyone involved and means youll spend less time hopping between tools, asking for updates or searching for the latest versions of files.
## No more silos  collaborate seamlessly by bringing external work into Notion
You can easily create Notion databases that sync with your Jira boards, Jira projects, GitHub PRs and GitHub issues, bringing information from those tools into a database you can use to manage, track and oversee projects.

##########################################

Synced Databases make life easier for all your team members, especially those who dont use GitHub or Jira, but still need to see whats going on. Instead of asking for logins and trying to navigate an unfamiliar tool, theyll have access to everything they need right in the Notion database.
No more pinging engineers on Slack for updates on an urgent bug fix  you can just go straight into the database and see whether its done, saving everyone time and stress.
Youll never have to manually update database entries with screenshots or links either, as the information will automatically pull through to the database for everyone to see.

##########################################

And, you can rest assured youll always be looking at the latest version of events, as the database will update whenever changes are made in the original tool. Synced Databases are read-only, so although you can bring information into Notion from GitHub and Jira, any changes to a ticket, task or PR need to be made in the original tool, providing a safeguard against unintentional edits and preserving your source of truth. Only team members authorized to edit GitHub or Jira are able to make changes in the tool. Its a good idea to leave a note at the top of the page letting people know who to get in touch with if they want to make any changes.

##########################################

Synced Databases help streamline project management and aid collaboration. People from different teams can work together on a single Notion page, where theyll share content, communicate and collaborate without needing to switch tools. You can also add more context to the information you pull into Notion. With relations and rollups you can link your Jira sprint to a larger team goal that lives in your OKRs database in Notion. When youre looking at those OKRs, youll see relevant info coming from Jira, making it easier to measure and report on your progress.

##########################################

## How to create and use Synced Databases with Jira
To set up a Synced Database, you must first authenticate Jira in Notion. To do this, go to Settings & Members in your side bar, and choose My connected apps. Click Connect underneath Jira, and youll be prompted to authenticate by logging in to your Jira account. After youve authenticated once, creating synced databases is as simple as pasting a link.

##########################################

You can now sync Jira boards or entire Jira projects into Notion. Heres how:
- In Jira, go to the board or project you want to sync, and copy the link.
- Paste it into Notion and select Paste as database.
- An empty database with a preset list of properties will show up in your page. It will show up in a Notion table view, with all Jira properties automatically added.
The database will start populating automatically and will continue to sync if you navigate away from the page.

##########################################

### Format your Jira Synced Database
Notion brings all Jira Issue types (Epics, Stories, Tasks, Bugs, Sub-tasks, etc.) to the synced database, where theyll appear as separate rows. Every Jira story will be linked to its relevant epic via a property called Parent, and sprints are also reflected in synced databases as separate properties.
You can create specific views using Notions database filters, for example, to show all tasks within a Sprint or the Stories, Tasks, and Bugs that make up an Epic.

##########################################

A kanban board can be a handy way to organize your sprints. To create one, first, selectAdd viewat the top of your synced database and selectBoard. Then click on database options (),Group by, and chooseStatus. Set theSorttoManualso you can move groups around and have To-Do, In Progress, and Done ordered properly.
As with any Notion database, you can create as many filtered views as you need, to organize your information in different ways.
- Create a calendar view to see when each task was created.
- Use a timeline to visualize how your epics relate to one another, and see how many projects your team is juggling at once.
- Add a board view grouping tasks by assigned engineer, so youll know exactly what everyones got on their plate.

##########################################

## How to use Synced Databases with Notion and GitHub
You can syncGitHub IssuesandPull Requestsinto Notion, and anyone who has access to the page will be able to see the content, even if they dont have access in GitHub.
Just like with Jira, you first have to authenticate with GitHub. Go toSettings & Members>My connected appsin the top left corner of your screen, and this time, youll click theConnectbutton under GitHub, and authenticate the account.
### Syncing GitHub Issues or Pull Requests
Once the authentication is successful, you can copy and paste links to GitHub Issues or Pull Requests into Notion pages.

##########################################

All you have to do is go to GitHub, copy the link for Pull Requests or Issues you'd like to sync, and paste it into Notion, selectingPaste as a databasewhen prompted.
An empty database with a preset list of properties will immediately show up, as a Notion table database with all GitHub properties in the database.
Within the next few minutes, the database will start populating automatically, and youll know its done once you seeSynced just nowin the database header.
You can create views and filters exactly as you can with Jira, and any other Notion database, for example, you can sort your database by Issue Number date to view the most recent Issues / Pull Requests first.

##########################################

## Connect your Synced Database to another Notion database
With the relation property, you can connect information from different databases in Notion. This can help give context and tie information together according to project or team. So youll be able to associate GitHub PRs with projects in your roadmap, for example.
To add a relation to your Synced Database:
- Go toProperties, and add a new property.
- Under advanced properties, selectRelationas the property type.
- Now a prompt will ask you which database youd like to relate. Choose and select the relevant database.
You can also mention items from your Synced Databases anywhere in Notion by using the@symbol just as you would mention any Notion page.

##########################################

### Automatic relations with Github and Jira
With Github and Jira Synced Databases, you can set up auto-relations, so any time an item in the Synced Database (a Github PR or a Jira Issue for example) includes a link to a Notion page in the auto-related Notion database in its description or title, the relation will automatically be populated. This makes it easier to keep track of Pull Requests and Tasks/Issues in Notion.

##########################################

- When you create a new relation in your Jira or Github Synced Database, toggle onAutomatically Relateand selectUpdate relation
- Now youll be able to add links to your Notion documents in your GitHub PR titles or descriptions or Jira Issues. To find the link, select the document in the database and clickCopy linkor open the document in a new tab and copy the link in your browser.
- Add the link in your description. Now, once the PR is synced into Notion, a relation between the task and the linked document will be automatically populated in the Synced Database.
- When you sync GitHub Pull Requests and Issues to Notion, you can search and mention individual PRs or Issues in your workspace using the@symbol just as you would mention any Notion document.

##########################################

### Use rollups to add additional info to a Jira board
Once youve created a relation property linking your Synced Database to another database in your workspace, you can bring specific information from one database into the other using a rollup property.
- Add a new property, choosingRollupfrom advanced properties, and give it a name.
- Click on a cell in the rollup column and youll be able to choose:The relation property you want to roll up.The property of the related database you want to roll up.The calculation you want to apply to them.
* The relation property you want to roll up.
* The property of the related database you want to roll up.
* The calculation you want to apply to them.

##########################################

Lets say you relate your Synced Database from Jira to your OKRs in Notion  - with a rollup, you can now visualize aggregated information, like percentage of tasks complete, right in Notion.
Or, you can relate your Meeting Notes database and use a rollup property to attach meeting notes, or see how many meetings youve had about any item.
## What you can do with Jira and GitHub Synced Databases
Synced Databases let you bring accurate information from Jira and GitHub into Notion. Once youve established that connection, theres really no limit to how you use that data  you can reference and resurface it throughout your workspace, keeping everyone up to date with work happening outside of Notion.

##########################################

- Manage individual workloads Add views for each team member to track high priority tickets, issues, and PRs all in one place. Personalized views help your team members reduce distraction and get laser-focussed on what they have to do.
- Connect GitHub issues with tasks Create a relation to your teams task dashboard in Notion, so you dont have to spend time copying GitHub issues to your tasks database manually.
- Create a summary view of related GitHub PRs, tasks, and Jira tickets By connecting your projects database in Notion to Github and Jira Synced Database, you can get a broader view of everything that makes up a project brief.
- Mention issues and tickets anywhere in your Notion workspaceYou can@mentionissues and tickets to quickly link to the relevant page of your Synced Database, just like you would with any other Notion page.

# Break tasks into manageable steps with sub-tasks and dependencies
When managing a busy team, your task database can become chaotic. Some tasks are quick and easy to complete, while others have a much broader scope and require many steps. Having all these tasks side by side gets confusing, and its hard to move forward when youre unsure of what comes next.
If you find yourself with more than 50 rows in your tasks database, sub-tasks and dependencies can help you get a clearer picture of exactly what needs to get done by breaking big tasks down into smaller actions.

##########################################

Its easier to scope out the steps to complete a task, share the workload amongst your team by assigning specific steps to different team members, and define what needs to happen for a task to be marked complete.
Youll quickly spot any tasks that are blocking your progress and need to get done before anything else.
Sub-tasks and dependencies are built using Notions relations properties. In this guide, well explain how to easily get set up and use sub-tasks and dependencies for task management.

##########################################

## How to use sub-tasks in your tasks database
Publishing content like a blog post might sound like a straightforward task, but as marketing teams will know, there are many steps involved, from initial research and outlining to drafting and reviewing. It probably requires input from two or more team members, and even after publishing your post, youll have a bunch more tasks to distribute and promote it.
Lets say you add a task to your database called Publish 10 Ways to Use AI in Marketing blog post. You can make this a parent task in your database, then create sub-tasks to research the topic, outline the post, write the draft, submit it for editing, review and publish.

##########################################

Some of those tasks might even have their own sub-tasks. For example, publishing the post might involve a final review and SEO check, formatting, adding images, writing a meta description, and uploading to your CMS.
Heres how to create a sub-item property in your tasks database:
- Click on themenu in the top right of the database, and selectSub-items.
- In theSub-itemswindow, youll create a self-relating property. You can rename the properties to Sub-tasks and Parent tasks.
- SelectCreate.
Now, youll see two new properties in the database, one for Parent tasks and one for Sub-tasks.
Any task in your database can have sub-tasks, which can be further broken down into smaller sub-tasks.

##########################################

To add sub-tasks to any item in the database, just hover over, click the drop-down that appears and add as many sub-tasks as you need. Sub-tasks can be viewed in both table and timeline views.
## How to use dependencies in timeline view
Use dependencies to mark a task as dependent on another.
For example, imagine youre working on a new feature launch. The order you complete tasks is important, as you cant start publishing guides and email content until youve finalized the UI.
You could use dependencies in a timeline view to flag tasks that need to be completed before you move on to the next. This functions in much the same way as sub-items and is just another way to visually connect your work.

##########################################

To add dependencies in timeline view:
- Go to themenu and click onDependencies.
- If no relation exists in the database, youll be prompted to create one. By default, it will be a self-relation calledDependencies.
- You can then choose whether to show dependencies by parent or sub-task.
- ClickCreate new relation.
When you hover over any database item in your timeline, an arrow will appear on the right side. You can click on the arrow and drag it to connect one task with another to create a dependency which will appear only in a timeline view.

##########################################

## Sub-tasks and dependencies make it easier to manage your teams work
When youre managing a fast-moving team, prioritizing and tracking everyones work is a major challenge. With sub-tasks and dependencies, you can juggle your teams daily work while simultaneously making progress towards larger objectives.

##########################################

Sub-tasks and dependencies help you:
- Break tasks into sub-tasks Many tasks in your task database are too broad to complete in one step, and actually require multiple actions, from more than one team member.  Breaking these large tasks down into individual steps makes it easier to set out and accomplish what needs to get done.
- Help team members collaborate to get tasks doneOnce youve broken a task down into its individual sub-tasks, you can then delegate or assign those smaller tasks to different members of your team. This helps your team collaborate, with everyone doing their part to reach your objectives.
- Identify blockers halting your progressSometimes progress is stalled because you cant move ahead until a certain task is complete. Dependencies make it obvious when this is happening, so you can prioritize getting it done and move on.

##########################################

## Ways to view subtasks and dependencies in a page
When you open a page in a database, you can view sub-items and dependencies as a relation at the top of the page.
Alternatively, you can choose to show sub-items as a page section, so when you open up a task, its immediately clear what all the subtasks are. In the sub-item section, you can click on the options menuand select which corresponding properties you want to display (status, assignee, due date, etc.) Having sub-tasks show up as a separate page section also makes it easy to add new tasks to the page.
## You can use database sub-items in many different ways
Sub-tasks and dependencies are primarily designed with task andproject managementin mind.

##########################################

However, you can use these properties for anything you need.
For example:
- Divide your OKRs into mini-goals Create a sub-item property inside your companys OKR database, and rename it to Sub-goals or Mini-goals. Then, you can add smaller goals that will add up to your overarching monthly, quarterly or annual goals.
- Create parent teams and child teams in an org chart You can use a sub-item property to create an org chart database, where you can see how each larger department is divided into smaller teams.
- Record monthly and weekly updates in your docs database Monthly update documents can become your parent items, with each weekly update a sub-item for the relevant month.

##########################################

# Building a comprehensive team notes & docs database

# Show your team how to organize, track and manage work in Notion
No matter what you need to do in your personal life, you plan and track it in Notion. You create systems that work for you and get things done in a workspace that reflects your personality.
Youve seen first-hand how your choice of tool can greatly impact your productivity and motivation. So why not bring your work life, and your teammates, over to Notion? They dont know yet, but it will help them collaborate seamlessly, easily access the information they need, and get more done.

##########################################

In this guide, well show you how you can take inspiration from your personal Notion dashboards to build a workspace where your team will collaborate and manage tasks with custom workflows, project hubs, and more.
## Why Notion is a powerful tool for your team
You already know how powerful Notion blocks are. A single tap of the slash command/, brings up a vast menu of things to create, like text blocks, images, videos, links, databases, embeds, and more.
Now imagine using Notion with your team: those same blocks that power personal planning and productivity can create product requirement documents, project trackers, and so much more.

##########################################

You could set annual and monthly goals, manage tasks and projects, draft documents, handle finances, take notes, collaborate across teams and keep all company information in one place.

##########################################

The possibilities are endless, and there are plenty of benefits to using Notion with your teams:
- Create a fully customizable workspace Notion gives you a blank page and the building blocks to create exactly what your team needs. You wont be boxed in by a pre-formatted tool. Instead, you can design a system that fits your natural workflow (and tweak it as things change).
- Keep it all in one place Everything from company benefits information, vacation forms, work documents, meeting notes, project and task tracking and information related to groups and hobbies can live in Notion, stored in the right place, so you never have to wonder where to find it.
- Provision the correct level of access for everyone Want to make sure everyone can see the companys top-level OKRs, but only senior management can make changes? Notions permissions and sharing settings allow you to give everyone the right level of access to documents and even share content with people outside the company.

##########################################

- Build smart connections between different aspects of work Using relation properties, you can build connections between databases like projects, tasks, goals, and meeting notes. Syncing your databases in this way means you can see things like how many tasks are left to complete on a project, which projects relate to which OKRs, and easily reference meetings related to a particular project.

##########################################

- Integrate with other tools and media within Notion Some teams will always need specialist tools. You can use synced databases to embed information from tools like Jira and Github into Notion, so information doesnt stay hidden in those tools and can be viewed by everyone who needs it. You can embed images, videos, web bookmarks, whiteboards, and much more into any Notion page, so theres no need to be constantly bouncing back and forth between tools.
Once youve got the go-ahead to try out Notion, its time to start building your team workspace.
## Setting up your team workspace
Theres no need to spend hours designing a complex system. You can build your workspace piece by piece and use our templates to help get things moving quickly.

##########################################

Start with the main building blocks of a company workspace, and you can expand and customize over time.
### 1. Create a company wiki
In your personal Notion space, you might have a dashboard or wiki that helps you navigate to your most-used pages, meaning information you need every day - your daily to-dos, a checklist for your dog-sitter, your weekly grocery list, etc - is always on hand.
You can create a version of this for your company workspace. Thecompany wikiwill become the homepage for everyone on your team, and the main page of your General company teamspace (the default teamspace that includes everyone.)

##########################################

One this top-level page you can keep things like employee directory, SOPS and guides, benefits information, vacation policy, the company mission, vision and values. You might even include the annual OKRs here and a link to each teams homepage.
### 2. Add teamspaces for each department
Teamspaces give each team an area for their work. They help organize the workspace in different categories so everyone knows where to go to find information relevant to their daily work.
You can create as many teamspaces as you have departments in your company - one for engineering, marketing, sales etc.
Teamspace admins can adjust permissions and sharing settings for teamspaces (and the pages within them). You can learn all about how teamspaces work inthis guide.

##########################################

### 3. Introduce some foundational databases
You can collect and organize pages in databases, and add multiple layers of information using properties. While you can start from scratch, we've simplified the process with pre-selected properties to get you going quickly. To get started-
- Click the+sign under your desired teamspace to get started.
- From there, you have the option to start from scratch or build with AI.
Choose from customizable pre-built properties
Click to expand
Whether you have something specific in mind or want inspiration, you have plenty of options - from popular templates to AI-guided setup.

##########################################

We recommend three key databases for your team to start with:
- A meeting notes database to capture essential insights from meetings Take notes from every meeting in themeeting notesdatabase. Draft an agenda, take notes, and tag the type of meeting and people who attended.
- A docs database for all company documents In yourdocuments databaseyou can store everything from project briefs, technical specs, one-pagers and more. Tag people who are involved and label the document type with a select property.
- A project & task management system If you use a database for your personal to-do list, you can create something similar for your team. Start with the Projects & Tasks template which youll find if you go to Templates in your sidebar. This template gives you two connected databases where you can tag people responsible for each task or project, mark task and project status, and see how many tasks have to be done for each project to reach completion.

##########################################

When youre comfortable with these databases, there are plenty more things you can do using databases in your team workspace. Heres just a few ideas:
- Track candidates for your open roles If youve ever used Notion to manage job applications, you can create a similarapplicant trackerto track candidates who apply to open roles in your company.

##########################################

- Record and tag company expenses Just like your personal budget tracker, you can use a Notion database to record and tag company expenses.
- Outline company OKRs for each quarter Record your company goals in a Notion database so everyone can see them, similar to how you outline your personal goals. You can relate this database to projects to ensure that day to day work stay aligned with larger company objectives.
In every database, you can get work done faster with templates. Draft meeting agendas, project briefs or sprint plans in a flash by creating templates in the database. Learn more about database templateshere.

##########################################

## Focus on your work with your own task dashboard
Within the company workspace, you can create your own personalized dashboard in yourPrivatespace in the sidebar and customize it according to how you work best.
To create a linked versions of another database, hit/, selectLinked view of databaseand choose the database you want to link, for example the task database.
Then, filter the database to only show work or notes that youre tagged in.

##########################################

If you want to change the database layout, go to options...,Layout. From here, select the layout that works best for you, be it a kanban board, calendar, timeline or table. You can add any additional filters that might be helpful, like a filter to show you all tasks due this week, tasks that areIn Progress, or those marked as high priority.
Now you have a customized task tracker that helps you stay super focussed and on track with your work. And, unlike an individual to-do list that stays hidden from the rest of the team, the work you do will be visible to all.

##########################################

## Collaborate effortlessly with teammates across the company
Notion is built for collaboration. Here are some ways you can foster easy collaboration with teammates and across teams:
- Create shared documents with one or two other peopleIf you need to share a document with just one or two others, you can create a new page inShared. This could be for your 1:1s with your line manager, or for a draft of a presentation you are working on with a teammate.
- Use comments to collaborate on a document Everyone who has permission to comment can leave comments throughout a page. This means team members can get fast feedback on their work, and you can ask for another team to leave suggestions on a document.
- Create an upvote database to brainstorm ideas for the next meetingTo get the opinions and priorities of your teammates, create an upvote database where people can enter suggestions, and everyone can vote for items they want to discuss.
- Share pages with another teamGive the engineering team access to comment or edit a document that the design team are working on. This can help collaboration across teams and ensure that cross-functional projects progress smoothly.

# Teamspaces give every team a home for important work
Whether your organization consists of 50 people, or 5000, chances are its made up of various teams, all working on their own tasks, projects, and goals that coalesce into your companys overarching objectives.
Notion is where you keep all of your knowledge  be it meeting notes, project roadmaps, launch calendars, content boards, ad-hoc docs, or general information such as your mission statement and benefits policy.
With all that knowledge living side by side in the company workspace, you need a clear path to the content you use day in, day out. Managers have to make sure everyone on their team is on track, and can find what they need to get work done.

##########################################

## Getting started with teamspaces
Teamspaces streamline access to information, creating a dedicated area for every team which can be customized to suit their way of working. Managers can empower their team members to find information and work independently, and can arrange the sidebar however makes sense for them. Instead of employees being overwhelmed with stuff they dont need, they have a slice of the workspace to call home, which contains everything they need to get down to work.

##########################################

## Team leaders can customize their teams area within the company workspace
Every team, and team member, has their own way of working. Teamspaces allow leaders to set up their department for success by designing a decluttered workspace-within-a-workspace, with custom permissions to ensure proper access to content.
However, that doesnt mean employees must be boxed in. People can join as many teamspaces as are relevant to their work (one for engineering, and one for the San Francisco office, for example) You can also view content in teamspaces you havent joined yet depending on the permissions settings of each teamspace.

##########################################

Each workspace will have at least one teamspace that includes everyone by default. This default teamspace will be named "General," and we recommend keeping all company-wide information, like your top-level goals, benefits policies, and mission statement.
### How to join teamspaces
- Scroll down the sidebar to All teamspaces
- All teamspaces youre a member of show up under Joined teamspaces
- Below that, youll see all the teamspaces you can join. Hover over the one you want, and just click Join.
- If the teamspace has an symbol next to it, that means its a Closed teamspace, and someone will need to invite you to join.

##########################################

## Create a teamspace for every department in your organization
Your Notion workspace doesnt have to be one size fits all. Most likely, the way your design team works will be very different to, say, engineering. With teamspaces, each department can choose how they view information and set up unique workflows.

##########################################

- Create a teamspace for every department in your company At Notion, we have teamspaces for marketing, sales, finance, engineering, and so on.
- Unite cross-functional, topic-based groups For example, you could create a teamspace for everyone in your London office. Individuals may belong to a few teamspaces based on their department and role in the company.
- Bring people together to collaborate on projects You can create a teamspace to organize the documentation and tasks for any kind of project, even if its short-term. When the work is done, you can archive the teamspace (all its contents can be recovered later, if you ever need them.)

##########################################

### How to create a teamspace
- Click the+button to the right of the teamspaces label in your sidebar, or go toAll teamspaces, and click+ New teamspace
- Give your teamspace a name and a description, and you can choose an icon.
- Choose the Permissions settings for your teamspace, and select Create teamspace
- Now the teamspace appears in your sidebar, and youll be prompted to add people to your new team. Simply type their email or name into the text box, and choose whether to add them as members or teamspace owners.
- To add everyone in your workspace automatically to your team, toggle on Make default teamspace. Most likely, youll only need one default teamspace, and wed recommend no more than three, even for large workspaces.

##########################################

## Organize your teamspaces for easy access and discoverability
The Notion sidebar is a tool for navigating around the workspace quickly, and you can customize the sidebar to make it easy for everyone to find what they need. Just click + next to your teamspace to add a top-level page that will appear in the sidebar, and you can then add the page content (and add as many sub-pages as required.)

##########################################

Here are some suggestions for some top-level pages to keep in the sidebar:
- Your teams homepage or wiki Depending on how you set up your sidebar (and the size of your team) this could look like a page for each sub team, or just one page for the whole team. Regardless, its important to have a homepage where everyone can come to find information.If youre using teamspaces to organize larger departments, we recommend creating one top level page for each sub team. For example, an engineering org might have a platform engineering home page, a marketing engineering home page, and so on.
* If youre using teamspaces to organize larger departments, we recommend creating one top level page for each sub team. For example, an engineering org might have a platform engineering home page, a marketing engineering home page, and so on.
- Key working documents Things your team members need to review everyday, like your shared roadmap or project launch calendar, work well as top-level pages.
- Read-only docs that everyone needs to see Mission statements, company history, or team offsite information can be kept in the sidebar.

##########################################

Team members can also Favorite their most-used pages by clicking the star icon at the top right of the page, meaning they can access what they need in just a couple of clicks.
As a Team leader, you also get control over who has access to what. Within your teamspace, you can change permissions settings and adjust what level of access people or groups have to pages.
So, for example:
- Managers should have full access to the whole teamspace. You can provision this in the teams settings menu under permissions.'
- Engineers working on projects in the Roadmap could have Can Edit access, meaning they can make changes in the page but arent able to share the page externally.
- People who arent members of the teamspace might have Can View access.

##########################################

If you want to make your OKRs read-only, or prevent certain pages from being shared, you can adjust the permission settings of those pages directly from the Share menu at the top right.
## Use Open, Private, and Closed Teamspaces to provision access to sensitive information
There are three kinds of teamspaces - Open, Private and Closed. With these three options, teamspace owners are able to control who has access to team information, and how that access is shared.

##########################################

- Open teamspaces Anyone can join an Open teamspace and view the content inside the teamspace. In Open teamspaces, everyone automatically has access to all pages, but you can change these permissions at the page level. To promote transparency, we recommend that most teamspaces should be set to Open by default.
- Closed teamspaces Everyone can see that the teamspace exists, but cant join unless theyre invited by an owner or member. Closed teamspaces are useful when you need some control over who can join, for example you could create a closed teamspace for all managers in your company.
- Private teamspaces (Enterprise Plan only) Only members or owners can add other people to a private teamspace, and it wont be visible to people who are not added. Use private teamspaces when a group is working on something sensitive that needs a degree of privacy or anonymity - HR might use a private teamspace for collecting and collaborating on employee feedback, or accounting may need to use a private teamspace when compensation and performance reviews are being discussed.

##########################################

You can easily edit your teamspace settings by clicking the optionsnext to your team and choosing Teamspace settings & members. The window that pops up has four different tabs:
- General Edit the name, description and teamspace icon. You can also archive the teamspace if you no longer need it.
- Members Add new members and groups to the teamspace. Click the drop down next to peoples names to make edit their role (whether they are teamspace owners or members) or remove them from the teamspace. If you are on an Enterprise Plan, you can also assign granular permissions to specific people or groups.

##########################################

- Permissions Choose whether you want your teamspace to be open, closed or private. Adjust the access levels for teamspace owners, members and everyone else with the dropdown menu where you can between Full access, Can edit, Can comment and Can view. In the Permissions tab you can also choose whether teamspace members can invite others, and edit the sidebar (or if you only want owners to have those abilities.)

##########################################

- Security (Enterprise Plan only)  Choose whether to allow members to share pages to the web, and you can toggle on or off inviting guests to pages, and exporting pages. Youll only be able to make these settings more permissive than the workspace-level settings if youre a teamspace owneranda workspace owner (e.g. guests are not allowed across the workspace, but you want them to be allowed for one teamspace).
Permissions in teamspaces
Click to expand
## Groups allow team owners to easily set default permissions in teamspace settings
There are different ways to share information in a Notion workspace. So whats the difference between Teams, Groups, and Shared pages?

##########################################

- Use teamspaces to organize content for a consistent working group  Keep all Engineering pages stored in a single teamspace, with top-level pages customized exclusively for that team. For team members, the information they need for their day-to-day work is easily discoverable.
- Groups allow team owners to easily set default permissions in Teamspace settings If youre on an Enterprise Plan, team owners can give individuals and groups different levels of access to certain pages in a teamspace, making some read-only or giving folks permission only to comment, or to edit the page but not share.
- Share pages when youre drafting work, or collaborating 1:1 For ad-hoc collaborations, rough drafts or 1:1 meeting notes, you can share a private page with an individual person.

# The best way to set up your teams sidebar for clear organization
Your sidebar is the map that helps you navigate all the pages in your workspace and access tools like search, settings, updates, and templates.
When its well-organized, you can get around quickly and create new pages in an instant, saving your team time they used to spend digging through messy docs folders. It provides a birds eye view of your workspace, and you can easily reshuffle the layout as needed.
In this article, youll learn all the features of the Notion sidebar, and well show you how to set it up for easy, fast access to everything you need.

##########################################

## You can also watch this video demonstration to see the sidebar in action:
Your companys mission control
To open the sidebar, hover over the top left of the screen. Click the arrows to lock the sidebar open, or toggle to show or hide using the shortcutcommand + \for Mac, orcontrol + \for Windows.
You can switch between all the workspaces you belong to using the drop-down menu in the top left corner of your sidebar. If you have multiple email accounts associated with Notion (like one for work and one for personal use), then youll see your workspaces organized by email.
Now lets take a tour of whats in your sidebar.

##########################################

- Quick Find use this (or hitcmd/ctrl + p) to search for anything in your workspace (including words inside pages). You can filter to find pages created by you, or edited in the last week. For example, its easy for your employees to search dental benefits and find the page with all the information they need to make their next appointment.
- Inbox here you'll find your notifications. Youll see reminders, or if you are tagged anywhere. Page updates are also visible here (in theFollowingtab). You can save time by replying to comments or messages directly in this menu.
"Updates" is now "Inbox"

##########################################

We're always working to improve your Notion experience. Recently, the "Updates" menu in the sidebar changed to "Inbox." This new experience has a better look and feel, and improved workflows for triaging notifications. Happy collaborating!

##########################################

- Settings & Members this is where you manage your account settings. You can change workspace settings, or configure your entire Notion account by changing your membership, notification settings, and more.
- Favorites you can go to the top right of any Notion page and clickFavorite. This will add the page to your favorites menu at the top of the sidebar. Keep frequently-visited pages here to access them in seconds.
- Workspace this is home to all top-level pages your team has. All workspace members can access these pages.
- Shared in this section, you'll see any pages that are shared only between you and at least one person in your workspace. You could use this space to collaborate with a teammate on the Q4 marketing plan before sharing it with the rest of the company.
- Private only you can access pages you create here. When youre ready to share with the team, just drag-and-drop them wherever they belong in the workspace.

##########################################

- Templates click to open up Notions template gallery. Well explain more about how to make the most of these later on, but know that you can use these as a springboard for pages you and your team might use.
- Import this button lets you transfer data from Evernote, Asana,Confluence, and other software right into Notion in a flash.
- Trash all deleted pages live here. You can either restore or delete them permanently.
## Organize your workspace for speed and efficiency
From the sidebar, you can quickly access any page in your workspace.
In the workspace section, youll first see all top-level pages (which can hold an infinite number of sub-pages).Its best to keep your sidebar organized at the highest level so its not overloaded.

##########################################

Give each team its own top-level page that acts as their wiki, holding all their team-specific information. You can also have a top-level page thats for everyone at the company, containing pages like Mission and Values, Benefits, or Vacation Policy.
You dont even have to click into these top-level pages to access their sub-pages. Use the toggle to see all the sub-pages and jump right in from the sidebar.
You can create new pages in the sidebar by clicking the+next to workspace, shared, or private (depending on what you need). If youve created aMeeting Notes database for the product team, youll want to see this as a sub-page in the product teams homepage. So, just drag-and-drop your new page into the Product top-level page. It now lives there.

##########################################

Here are some tips from the Notion team to help you get the most out of your sidebar.
- Try hiding the sidebar for a clean, minimal page where you can focus on your work and eliminate distractions.
- Top-level pages in your workspace section should represent the overarching departments of your company. But at Notion, we also have company-wide Meeting Notes and Docs databases shared by everyone. We then use a series of tags to organize these by department or type of meeting/document. Learn more aboutteam notes & docs.

##########################################

- It's a good rule of thumb to stick to a small number of top-level pages and file all your other pages and work inside of them. The toggles will always give you clear pathways to what you need.
- Use the private section to work solo before a page is ready for collaboration. With Notionssharing and permissions settingson the top right of any page, you can add teammates to get their feedback or input. Once shared, the page then moves into the shared section of your sidebar. When its ready for company-wide use, simply drag it into the workspace section.
- Rotate your favorites depending on what youre working on at any given time. You might be executing a product launch for the month and need to reference that page frequently. But after that? Drag it into your archive and make space for the next project page.
- Create an archive page where you can easily drag-and-drop old projects, finished work, and anything you no longer need but may want to reference later.

##########################################

## Our templates give you a springboard
Weve designed a library of templates for teams and individuals that you can access at the click of a button, which makes building out your companys Notion workspace a breeze.
When you openTemplatesin the sidebar, you can start browsing the Notion template gallery all organized based on your needs.Weve got a range of templates to choose from  youll find everything from user research databases and content calendars, to job boards and company home pages, to engineering roadmaps and a sales CRM.
Youll find plenty of inspiration in our fulltemplate gallery.

# The only Notion setup you need for keeping New Years resolutions
Accomplishing goals is all about daily progress  and when your goals are in one place, theyre top of mind and actionable.
Normally, theyd be buried in different tools. An app for tracking fitness. Another for your reading list. One for finances. You shouldn't have to check three different apps just to see what you need to do in a day. After all, the key to hitting goals is to keep them front and center.
With Notion, you can unite all the different types of goals you have, break them into manageable tasks and timelines, and see how youre tracking toward those big picture changes.

##########################################

### In this piece you'll learn
- 1Tips for conducting a yearly retrospective.
- 2How to create dashboards that connect everything you need to accomplish your goals.
- 3Techniques for staying on top of your resolutions throughout the year.

## Soon, you could have a planner that looks like this:
Look back at last year
Conducting a yearly retrospective shapes your planning because it surfaces what's most important to you.
Steve Schlafman is a coach and the founder of boutique leadership development company High Output. When it comes to his yearly retro, he says, "It's really hard to know what you want and what you value without doing that inventory."

##########################################

Steve finds it helpful to look at the past year through five different lenses:
- Success and growth
- Falling short
- People and relationships
- Health and wellness
- Lessons and themes
Each of these sections has distinct questions meant to put things into perspective in different areas of your life. He asks questions like What do I wish I accomplished?, What am I most proud of personally and professionally?, and What am I most thankful for? When turning these into high-level goals for the next year, Steve suggests the "stop doing, start doing, and keep doing" format.

##########################################

Marie Poulin, a digital strategist and designer who helps businesses create systems for their work, puts all responses in a Notion database. In a Notion page dedicated to planning, she uses aGallerywhere each page is its own year. That way, as she's planning the year, the retrospective on the past year is nestled in a toggle, top of mind.
This is also helpful for some of the fine points she wants to put on the year to come, like certain words or vision statements that keep her focused on what's most important.
"These anchor how you want to feel. It's not something you do once and it gets buried," she says. "It's something that gets baked into your weekly reviews or quarterly reviews. It's always there."

##########################################

## Set your highest-level goals
These should be the biggest things you want to accomplish this year, serving as your North Star. If it's helpful, look at your yearly retrospective to focus these goals in distinct areas of your life.
Some people say I should do this or I need to do this. Then theres people who say Im willing to do this, says Steve. Focus on what youre willing to do.
What matters to you? Set goals with the intention to do them.

##########################################

Here's how you might do that in Notion:
- Create aTablefor all your goals. Eventually, we'll connect this database to your projects and actions needed to accomplish these goals.
- Use aSelectproperty to categorize these goals based on the areas you identified in your yearly retrospective. These can be things like "Health and Fitness," "Personal Development," or "Career Growth."
- Use anotherSelectproperty to assign the goal a status. Think "In Progress," "Complete," or "De-prioritized."
- For now, this database can remain simple. We'll start usingRelationproperties so you can see all the tasks associated with each of these goals.
## Plan how you'll achieve your goals
Too many resolutions are set and then forgotten.

##########################################

When your goals live alongside the work you do every day, theyre never more than a click away. This ensures theyre never forgotten, and get integrated into your daily life.
Marie uses a series of connected databases to uncover what projects roll up into her high-level annual goals, and then what tactical actions are needed to complete those projects (and thus, her goals).
"Notion is the only place I have found that allows me to see both high-level and really granular information in the same place without having to jump around," says Marie. "It keeps me following through on the bigger picture stuff that really matters."

##########################################

We'll walk you through how to do this yourself. Lets start by creating distinct Notion databases and connecting them to your goals:
- Create a newTablefor your projects. Think about those big goals, and what smaller-level projects or milestones are needed to achieve them. Each page in the table should be a project. For example, if your goal is to pay off your credit card debt, a project might be to do a balance transfer.
- Create a separateTablefor next actions. These should be the actionable things you need to do for each project. One next action for your balance transfer might be researching credit cards without a balance transfer fee. List out all the actions related to each project.
- UsingRelationproperties, connect all your databases. Goals, projects, and next actions should all be connected so you can see what youre doing to accomplish your goals.

##########################################

Now you can start assigning timelines to your goals, projects, and next actions. You'll do something similar to what you just did above.

##########################################

- Create two separateGalleries, one for quarters and months.
- In the quarter gallery, make each yearly quarter its own page. "Q1," "Q2," etc.
- Do the same thing for the month gallery, making each month a page.
- Use aRelationproperty to connect your goals database to your quarters database, assigning each goal to one of the year's four quarters.
- In the months database, useRelationproperties to connect your goals, projects, and next actions databases. This way, you can see what you need to do each month, both at the granular level of actions and big picture level of goals.
- You can get even more granular, assigning timelines for projects and dates for actions.

##########################################

Having several, connected databases gives you the ability to see your goals and actions many different ways, whether that's by the month, by the quarter, or seeing all the tasks associated with a project. Instead of jumping between apps or your calendar to see everything you need to do, it's all in one place.
## Systems for accountability
You can make custom views of any database, depending on the information you need to see. Whether its a view thats projects for the quarter or tasks for the week, everythings in one place.
To stay accountable, Marie uses linked databases with specific views everywhere in her workspace to tighten her focus, knowing shes working toward her goals.

##########################################

- Marie keeps a weekly planner as a Notion gallery, where each page is its own week. Inside those pages is a linked view of her actions database, filtered to see only actions she needs to complete that week. This weekly planner is a template, so whenever she starts a new week, its spun up in one click.
- In her top-level planning page, Marie keeps full-page databases for goals, projects, months, quarters and years. That way, she can click into any and see whats happening and when.

##########################################

- She also conducts reviews every week and every quarter. Again, these are templates with a set of questions to help assess how she felt, how things went that week or that quarter. But they also have a view of her goals database, so she can track her progress toward these goals.
By doing this on a regular basis, it makes monthly, quarterly and yearly planning a lot easier, says Marie. Notion allows me to see all that data and get a really good snapshot.
## Templates to try for your yearly planning
Instead of creating your own yearly planning process from scratch, you can also duplicate these templates right in your workspace and customize them to your needs. Plus, there are plenty more2022 planning templatesin the Notion template gallery.

# The ultimate guide to Notion templates
Notions Template Gallery is the home for all Notion templates built by and for the community. Whether youre an individual looking for a daily habit tracker or a grocery list, or an enterprise company looking for a team knowledge base or an editorial calendar, the Template Gallery is the best source of truth.
In this guide, well dive into templates, how to find and use templates to improve your workflows, and how you can create your own.

##########################################

## What is a Notion template?
A template is a prebuilt Notion page that you can add into your workspace. Instead of trying to rebuild a simple page or a complex workflow, simply add a Notion template into your workspace and get started. Templates can be anything from a team knowledge base to a personal workout tracker, and everything in between.
## Finding, using, and customizing a Notion template
Notions Template Gallery is the premier place to find any templates you might need. It includes over 250 searchable categories and creator profiles, making it easier than ever to find a template for your specific use case.

##########################################

### How to find templates
To find a template, navigate tonotion.com/templates. On the Template Gallery home page, youll find a few primary sections:
- Search bar Search by keyword, team, category, creator, and more to find the perfect template for you. Simply type in your word or phrase to find templates, categories, and creators that match your search term.
- Categories Navigate through various categories and sub-categories to discover various use cases. As you click into categories, youll find more specific categories and use cases to help you narrow down your search.
- Popular templates See the most used templates from the past week in the Notion community across work, student, and personal use cases.
- Top categories See the most used categories and sub-categories from the past week.
- Template collections Find pre-built collections of templates on a specific topic or workflow. Use as many templates as youd like to start building our your new workflow.

##########################################

Click theTemplatesbutton in the Notion sidebar to get started. This will open a popup window of the Template Gallery in Notion. Once there, use the dropdown menu in the upper left corner to select your category and see popular subcategories in the sidebar.
Alternatively, you can use the search in the upper left to find specific templates that fit your needs.
### How to use templates
Once you identify the template(s) youd like to use, click theStart with this templatebutton. If youre already signed into Notion, the template will automatically be added to your workspace in the Private section of your sidebar. If youre logged out or dont have a Notion account, youll be prompted to sign in or create an account first.

##########################################

You can also play around with templates and see how they work before deciding to add them into your workspace. To do this, clickView templateto see the template in action and click through the templates sections and features.
### Customizing your template
Once youve added a template into your workspace, you have endless options for what you can change, edit, or update to fit your needs. Templates are just a starting point to help you create your ideal workspace.

##########################################

Here are a few common updates and changes that you can make once duplicating a template:
- Pages Update the page cover photo, add/change an icon, and change the page title.
- Text Add formatting, like bold, italics, text color, and background color. Change heading levels, add bullet or numbered lists, and move sections around.
- Blocks Add blocks like callouts, toggle lists, or tables. Remove blocks that you dont need to reduce clutter or make space for extra blocks.
- Databases Change property names, types, and icons, or add/remove properties that dont fit your needs. Add new database views, like boards, lists, calendars, timelines, or galleries.

##########################################

## Creating and sharing your own templates
Any publicly shared page in Notion that can be duplicated is considered a template. This enables the entire Notion community to share its favorite workflows with other Notion users with a simple click of a button.
### What makes a good template?
If you have a specific template or workflow youd like to share with the community, we highly encourage you to create and submit a template!
Before you set off building and sharing, there are some important considerations for creating a template:
Good templates are useful.Templates are tools; tools solve a clear problem or need for someone. Theres both a clear audience for your template and a clear problem to be solved, and your template solves that problem.

##########################################

Good templates are differentiated.Notion is more flexible than typical word document. Differentiated templates combine one or more of Notions core product types (docs, projects, and wikis), or are very clearly visually different than a basic word document.
Good templates are scalable.If your template is intended for team use, it should be able to work with more than just one person. There are a few key points to check to ensure scalability:
- If its intended for collaboration, what might this look like if you added 10 people? 50? 100?
- If you added content from the last two months, what would it look like?
- If you already have lots of stuff in your Notion, does it easily fit in?

##########################################

Good templates have the basics.Theyre inoffensive, use correct spelling, and are thoughtfully structured.
Add directions to make your template easier to use
At the top of or throughout your template, include a tutorial (like a Loom video) or written instructions for how to use, tweak, or customize the template.

# The ultimate quickstart guide to Notion for Enterprise
## Getting started with Notion Enterprise
Getting started with Notion for Enterprise gives you access to more customizability and control over admin, security, provisioning, and more. There are plenty of features to explore within your company workspace, so its important to understand the scope of whats available.
In this guide, well discuss some of the most vital features available for Enterprise and a few best practices for building a clean, productive, and secure Notion workspace that meets your organizations needs.
Learn more about security & compliance
For more information on security & compliance best practices on Notion Enterprise, check out this guide.

##########################################

### Setting up user types
There are four types of users on Notion Enterprise, all consisting of varying levels of permissions, so its important to organize users based on their intended usage:
- Workspace ownershave full access to all workspace settings and have elevated privileges, such as the ability to add new members. Every workspace must have at least one owner.
- AMembership adminis an administrative role built specifically for Enterprise user management that allows Workspace owners to delegate membership responsibilities. Ensuring members have access to the right workspace and relevant groups is often managed by IT teammates, Product Ops, or other functional Chiefs of Staff.
- Membersare paid users and have full access to the workspace, including a personal section of the workspace. This is the default role when joining a workspace, and is a good role for most people at your company. All members are allowed to view, create, and share pages, and is a good way to maximize usage of Notion without granting additional administrative privileges.
- Guestsare free users, but are limited to the specific pages that theyve been granted access to and do not have a personal section of the workspace. These users are intended for external collaborators and are not supported by SSO & SCIM.

##########################################

Notion has plenty of flexibility when it comes to user type delegation. As our customers grow on Notion, its a best practice to limit the number of workspace owners that have full access to all workspace settings (such as Audit Log, Content Search, and Identity & Provisioning) to a smaller administrative team.
### Using teamspaces to organize information
Teamspaces provide streamlined access to information by creating a dedicated area of your companys workspace that can be customized to meet the requirements for a specific team or project.

##########################################

Most organizations set up a company teamspace for all users, plus individual teamspaces for every department (like Product, Engineering, Marketing, Customer Success, etc.). Individual users can be added to specific teamspaces, limiting the information that is openly accessible.
Creating Teamspaces
To create a teamspace in Notion, you can click the+icon next to Teamspaces in the sidebar, or you can use theNew teamspacebutton located in Settings & members > Teamspaces.
Adding structure to teamspaces
To enforce a more structured workspace, you can limit teamspace creation to workspace owners only using the toggle underSettings & members > Teamspaces.
To learn more about how workspace owners can set up teamspaces,read our guide here.

##########################################

Adding and Managing Teamspace Members
By default, workspace members wont see new teamspaces, though its easy to add members to specific teamspaces. In Teamspace settings > Members, you can search existing workspace members or groups or add members manually via email.
Once a member is added to a teamspace, their role can be toggled between member or teamspace owner for additional privileges.
Teamspace-Specific Settings
Each teamspace has its own settings (separate from workspace settings) so you can control more granular options for each area that you create.

##########################################

For organizations focused on ensuring that information stays secure within their workspaces, check the following settings to make sure they align with your needs:
- Disable public page sharingdictates whether a page can be published to the web.
- Disable guests limits sharing of current teamspace to workspace members only.
- Disable exportturns off the ability for users to export pages from this teamspace.
## An Introduction to Workspace Settings
As a workspace owner, you can easily build out your organizations Notion instance in a way thats custom to your company.Settings & membersis where you can control the finer details, like access and membership, permissions, plan and billing information, security, and more.

##########################################

Before you start working in Notion, its important to understand what settings exist for your workspace and what they do. Lets cover a few basics, then well dive into specific sections in more detail later in this guide.
### Settings(Workspace owners only)
This section is the starting point for many companies, as its where you set up a few of the most important basic settings that appear internally and externally.

##########################################

- Nameset the name of your companys workspace. This is often just your company name (we set ours to readNotion), but can be customized to what fits best.
- Icon upload an image (usually your company logo) for your workspace.
- Workspace Domain create a personalized domain for your workspace. This domain is used for two reasons:Pages shared to the web will be shared using this domain ([domain].notion.site)Anyone with an allowed email domain can join the workspace using this domain (www.notion.so/[domain])
* Pages shared to the web will be shared using this domain ([domain].notion.site)
* Anyone with an allowed email domain can join the workspace using this domain (www.notion.so/[domain])
- Allowed Email Domains add your workspaces allowed email domains. Any users with email addresses that belong to the domain(s) listed here can automatically join your workspace. For most organizations, this is their company email domain (i.e.,acmeinc.com). To get started, there needs to be at least one confirmed member with the domain before it can be added.

##########################################

For more information, continue on to theAllowed Email Domainssection below.

Widely-used public domains such asgmail.comandoutlook.comcant be set as allowed email domains.
### Teamspaces(Workspace owners only)
General teamspace settings allow you to control settings that apply globally to your workspace.
- Default teamspaces choose the teamspaces that all new and current workspace members automatically join.
- Limit teamspace creation toggle this setting on to only allow workspace owners the ability to create teamspaces.
- Manage all teamspaces this section is where you can manage all teamspaces and their respective settings. See members, security settings, and access levels by teamspace.

##########################################

### Members(Workspace owners & Membership admins only)
Here is where Workspace owners and Membership admins can view and manage members, groups, and guests in the workspace.
- Manage members and access make sure all members in your workspace have the right level of access and that they are in the correct teamspaces.
- Set up permissions groups these allow you to easily manage page permissions and teamspace access in bulk, rather than on an individual member basis.
Managing permissions groups with an IdP
If you plan to leverage SCIM, we recommend creating and managing groups from your IdP to ensure they sync properly with Notion. Some SCIM applications may not support importing groups, meaning they wont pull any groups created in Notion.

##########################################

- Monitor guest accessreview any guests that currently have access to your companys workspace, and revoke access if necessary.
Adding guests in Notion
Guests can only be added at the page level via the Share menu.
- View and manage users who have recently left the workspaceview the log of members that left the workspace in the last 30 days. To prevent data loss, you can transfer ownership of those users private pages to another member (i.e., to their manager).
- Manage workspace and guest requestsmembers can request new people to be added as members or guests into your workspace. Workspace owners and membership admins can approve or decline these requests here. You can find more information about guest invite requests here.

##########################################

Adding members without an IdP
If you arent using an Identity Provider (IdP), this is where you can also manually add/remove members.
### Billing(Workspace owners only)
Workspace plan and billing information can be found here to help manage all aspects of billing in Notion.
- For customers on automated billing, you can update your plan and billing intervals (monthly vs annually) here
- For customers on quarterly true-ups via the Sales team, please work with your dedicated Account Management team for any questions about your Enterprise license
Billing with Allowed Email Domains enabled
The cost for any members who have joined the workspace via Allowed Email Domains will be added to your Enterprise License.

##########################################

### Security(Workspace owners only)
Learn more about your workspace security settings in our guide here.
### Other Settings for Workspace Owners
Identity & provisioning
Verify your domain, manage workspaces that belong to your domain, and configure SAML SSO & SCIM in theIdentity & provisioningtab. For more information, continue to theManaging Users in Notionsection below.
Content Search
Filter and search the workspace content and manage permissions on pages as needed. For more information, continue to theContent Searchsection below.
Connections

##########################################

With Notions API, you can connect other software tools to your workspace for even more functionality within your workspace. There are additional settings for managing these connections on the Enterprise plan so workspace owners can regulate who in the workspace can install them:
- No restrictionsall workspace members can install connections in the workspace
- Only from approved listworkspace members can only install connections that are pre-approved by a workspace owner
To learn more about managing connections in your workspace, please refer to our Help Center article here.
Audit Log
Provides an overview of a large range of events that have occurred in the workspace. For more information, continue to theAudit Logsection below.

## Managing Users in Notion
There are multiple ways to manage users in Notion depending on your organizations preferences and needs.
### User Authentication through SAML SSO
Notions SAML SSO is built upon the SAML 2.0 standard, connecting your Identity Provider (IdP) and workspace(s) for an easier, more secure login experience. Notion supports official configurations for SAML SSO with: Azure, Google, Gusto, Okta, OneLogin, and Rippling.

##########################################

To get started using SAML SSO with Notion, you will need to complete the following steps:
- Verify domain(s)to use advanced security features, you must verify ownership of your email domain. This is an automated process that involves adding a TXT record onto your domains DNS to verify your ownership of it.
- Enable SAML SSOthis will toggle the feature on and complete the configuration.For more information on completing the SAML SSO configuration, please refer to ourIDP-specific guides.
- Change default login methodonce SAML SSO is enabled for the first time, the default login method will be set toAny method, meaning that users have the option of logging in via SAML or their normal login method. By setting this toOnly SAML SSO, this enforces SAML as the login method for your workspace.
- Link additional workspaces (optional)if you have more than one workspace youd like to configure with SSO, you can do so by reaching out to[emailprotected].

##########################################

Once properly configured, any members signing into your workspace(s) will need to use the verified domain and will need to be authenticated through your identity provider. Enterprise workspace owners are able to bypass by using an alternative login method in case theres an IdP/SAML SSO failure.

Guests are not supported through SAML SSOor SCIM.
### User Provisioning
While most of our Enterprise customers leverage an Identity Provider (IdP) to provision new users, there are many ways to add a new user account to your workspace:
Manually by Email
Workspace owners and Membership admins can add a new member to the workspace by email underSettings & members>Members.
Allowed Email Domains

##########################################

Any users that login to Notion with your domain(s) listed in the Allowed Email Domains setting will be able to join the workspace as a member, and the additional cost will be added to your Enterprise License.
Allowed Email Domains and IdP
If youre planning to manage the members that get added to your workspace strictly via your IdP, we recommend removing any domains listed in the Allowed Email Domains setting inSettings & members > Settings.
Just-in-time (JIT) Provisioning

##########################################

Notion supports Just-in-Time provisioning when using SAML SSO. WhenAutomatic account creationis enabled inSettings & members > Identity & provisioning, any user who logs into Notion for the first time via your SAML SSO connection will have a new member account generated using the name and e-mail on the SAML response.
Using JIT and SCIM
We don't recommend enabling Just-in-Time provisioning if you are using SCIM, as there could be a mismatch between membership in your IDP and in Notion.
Invite Link
UnderSettings & members>Members, youll find an option to enable an invite link. Once enabled, you may share this link and anyone that visits it will be able to join your workspace automatically without the need for you to enter their email manually.

##########################################

SCIM API
Notion has a SCIM API which can be used to provision, manage, and de-provision members and groups. Workspace owners can find the required API key by going toSettings & members>Identity & provisioning>SCIM Configurationand clicking to view the token.
Please seeour SCIM documentationfor the latest information on how you can interact with Notions SCIM API. Notion supports official SCIM applications with Azure, Google, Gusto, Okta, OneLogin, and Rippling.
Getting started with SCIM
Configure and enable SCIM provisioningpriorto assigning members to the application to ensure provisioned user identifiers are captured correctly.
Details about SCIM applications

##########################################

The Google SCIM application does not support Group provisioning and de-provisioning. For other IdPs without an official application, you can reference ourSCIM API documentationto set up a custom SCIM integration.
When setting up SCIM for multiple workspaces, while you can have one IdP tenant for SSO setup, you will need a separate application for each workspace as the API keys for SCIM operate only at the workspace level.
### User De-provisioning
When its necessary to de-provision a member, its important to remove them from a workspace and transfer their content to an existing member.
Manually in Members tab

##########################################

Workspace owners and Membership admins can remove a user from the workspace underSettings & members > Members. Sessions for these users are immediately terminated and they cant rejoin a workspace themselves and must be added back manually or via SCIM.
Automatically via SCIM
SAML SSO doesnt include automatic de-provisioning of users by itself. For this use case, you must be using our SCIM API with your Identity Provider to send requests for de-provisioning.
Please seeour SCIM documentationfor the latest information on how you can interact with Notions SCIM API.
Transferring user content

##########################################

When a member leaves a workspace, they will appear underSettings & members > Membersin theRecently Lefttab. From here, you can transfer their private pages to another user.
These pages will be packaged under one document now located under the newly selected membersPrivatesection in the left sidebar.
### Visibility & controls for managed users
Enterprise workspace owners have additional settings that can help add more granularity and control over how their managed users work in Notion. Find these settings underSettings & members > Identity & provisioning > User Management.
Understanding "managed users" in Notion

##########################################

A "managed user" includes any account created with the organization's verified email domain. Continue to the Managing your domain in Notion section below for more detail.
Settings for managing users accounts
Admins have access to multiple important settings that help manage and control user accounts in Notion.

##########################################

- Allow users to change account information set if users can change their preferred name, email address, and profile photo.
- External workspace access control if managed users are able to join workspaces that are not owned by your organization.
- Prevent managed users support access control which users can allow Notion support to remote login for troubleshooting. For more information on what Notion support can view, look at our terms of service.
- Session Duration set how long a user can be logged in before they will be required to re-authenticate. This includes all devices a user is logged in on.
Changing default session duration

##########################################

Notion has a default session duration of 90 days, but workspace owners can change this to a number of options from 1 hour to 90 days

- Log out all users force all users to log out immediately.
- Reset passwords for all users force all users to reset their passwords.
Dashboard of managed users
Click theView dashboardbutton to get an overview of all users in your verified domain. There, youll find information about each user, like their name, email address, workspaces, last activity date, and two-step authentication status.

##########################################

Within each specific user account in this dashboard, workspace owners can perform the following actions:
- Suspend users
- Delete users
- Change user's name and email addressNote: The new email must belong to the verified domain
* Note: The new email must belong to the verified domain
- Log out users
- Reset passwords
- Remove user from external workspaces
## Managing your domain in Notion
In addition to being a prerequisite to configure SAML SSO on Notion, once youve verified a domain, you can regulate and manage workspaces that belong to your verified domain(s). To do so, clickBrowse workspacesunderSettings & members > Identity & provisioning > Domain Management.

##########################################

To help mitigate concerns and confusion for future users, after a domain is verified, every time a new workspace is created using the verified domain, an email notification will be sent to the respective workspace owner alerting them that their workspace is eligible for domain management.
Initially verifying your domain
When you first verify a domain, theres a 14-day notification period to inform all users that belong to that domain that their workspace(s) are eligible for domain management actions by their Enterprise workspace owners. During this period, you will not be able to act on any of the workspaces in the domain management view.

##########################################

### Customize workspace creation permissions
To help regulate the workspaces created using your verified domain, you can customize the permissions for who can create workspaces underIdentity & provisioning > Domain management > Workspace creationand select Only workspace owners.

This setting only applies to workspace owners from the primary domain-verified workspace.

##########################################

### View unmanaged workspaces
Once a domain is verified, Enterprise workspace owners can clickBrowse workspacesto view all non-Enterprise workspaces that users have created with their verified domain. There will be a tab for single member and multi-member workspaces. The following information will be provided in the view for each workspace:
- Workspace name
- Plan type
- Number of members
- Workspace owners
- Created at
- Created by
The actions available will show on the far right side.
### Single member workspace actions
In the single member tab in the workspace view, you will see all the personal workspaces that have been created using your verified domain.

##########################################

For some customers to meet compliance requirements, they dont want any work projects being stored in single member (personal) workspaces. In the workspace view, you will see the option toRequire account changenext to each single member workspace. This will require that the owner of the single member workspace provide a non-corporate email address for the user account before they can access the workspace again. This is a great option for employees that may have created a single member workspace with their company email, but mostly have non-work projects theyd like to keep for personal use . As a best practice, we recommend working with the respective workspace owners and to move any work related pages to a sanctioned Enterprise workspace prior to requiring the account owner change.

##########################################

To help clean up stale single member workspaces that were owned by a former employee, you can delete the workspace from the workspace view underDomain Management.
When you delete a workspace, an email notification will be sent to the respective workspace owner informing them of this and providing your email address as the contact for any questions. Users will have the option for a one-time-only extension on the deletion period for an additional 30 days.
Domain management support
Notions support team cannot override any domain management actions by Enterprise workspace owners. If a user reaches out to Notion with questions, we will provide the email of the Enterprise workspace owner so the user can reach out directly.

##########################################

If needed, the workspace can be restored by the Enterprise workspace owner in the domain management view within 30 days.
The following content can not be recovered:
- Favorites
- Guest access
- Configured integrations (Bots)
- Domains (custom Notion domains)
If the single member workspace is associated with a current employee, we advise caution before deleting the workspace in case it would be better toRequire account changeto a non-corporate email address and preserve the workspace settings.
Understand your workspace's data retention rules
Click to expand

##########################################

### Multi-member workspace action
In the multi-member tab in the workspace view, you will see all the Plus and Business plan workspaces that are eligible to claim:
- Workspace was created using your verified domain
- Has at least one workspace owner (could be the creator or another workspace owner) still in the workspace that belongs to your verified domain
- Not on the Enterprise plan

##########################################

To help establish governance over authorized workspaces, you can claim ownership of eligible workspaces and upgrade them to the Enterprise plan. When the claim has been successfully processed:
- Invoice will be sent to the billing contact provided for the Enterprise upgrade
- Workspace owner that claimed the workspace will become the only workspace owner
- Previous workspace owners are downgraded to members (workspace owners can re-assign roles and permissions as necessary)
Other than the new primary workspace owner, there will be no noticeable difference for the workspace members.
Reminder to assign Membership Admins on claimed workspaces as needed to manage members and groups.

##########################################

## Workspace consolidation
After claiming ownership of your workspaces and adding them to your Enterprise license, you may want to consider consolidating your users and content. Consolidating into a single, primary workspace (or small set of production workspaces) adds two primary benefits:
- Standard and secure admin controls:With all users and content in one place, it's easier to streamline admin controls and user management, instead of managing both across multiple workspaces.
- More discoverable content and collaboration:Since content will live in one workspace, it will be easier for users to find and access all of the content they need and collaborate in a single tool.

##########################################

You can request a consolidation through your dedicated Account Management team. If you dont have a dedicated Account Manager, you can reach out to our Support team at[emailprotected]for more information.
## Data, Reporting, & Auditing
Enterprise workspace owners have access to additional data and reporting for greater insights into content and overall workspace usage. Whether youre looking to export information, track and audit events, or search existing content, there are options available to help you do so.
For more information on data, reporting, and auditing, check out our guide on security & compliance here.

Better databases have arrived!

##########################################

While the concepts outlined in this guide are still useful, references to specific product actions may be a bit outdated! Databases were redesigned in March 2022, so your experience may differ slightly from whats pictured and described here.This guideoutlines the new database features, including what's changed.

##########################################

## Your team needs a better content calendar system
Keep marketing on message. Manage your bloggers. Stay aligned with sales. Stick to your content cadence across channels. You need to tackle these challenges to hit your big goals. But content too often runs into trouble because of:
- Poor communication marketers get input from everywhere. Feedback from engineering on product positioning, input from design on blog visuals. These conversations arent documented in a single spot leading to miscommunication and project delays.
- No vision into all the content youre producing because new content comes in many forms (blog content, videos, social media posts, etc.) its easy for digital marketing managers to miss the forest through the trees. Strategy becomes unclear, leaving you and your team without an obvious path to meet goals.
- Fixed systems that diminish your team's potential youre creating all kinds of content. A rigid system is only slowing your team down. You need functionality in software, something adjustable to each project and person on your content team.

##########################################

In Notion, you can:
- Have one space for everything blogs, videos, webinars, social media and any other pieces of content can all live in a single calendar. Beyond knowing each projects status, you can also keep creative briefs, strategy docs, assets and feedback in one place. Then your team can focus on driving results instead of searching email threads.
- Produce consistent, high-quality content help your team execute on-brand for the different types of content theyre creating. Set a process and provide important materials like brainstorm frameworks or style guides every time, arming your team to keep things consistent across the board.
- Customize project work and tracking you can not only create custom ways for tracking the status or whos working on a project, but also customize all the components of these projects based on their specific needs.

##########################################

## How to set up your marketing team's content calendar
Whether youre an in-house marketer or content marketing consultant with a dozen clients, all your planning and management can come together here.Instead of a static calendar tool that points you to the work (which probably lives across many tools), this system serves dual purposes  allowing all your content creation to happen in the same place you're tracking it.
### 1. Create your database
In Notion, you can create different types of databases including a table, calendar, list and board. In this case, we'll be looking at first establishing a content calendar using a board.

##########################################

- Create a board databaseto see all the things you can add to a Notion page, hit/. We call this the slash command. On your marketing teams homepage, you can create a specific page for your content calendar by typing/boardand selectingBoard-Full page. This will open up a page for your content calendar. Then you can get started adding individual blogs, podcasts, social posts and more to map out your content schedule.
- With boards, team members can stay in the loop by quickly seeing the status of work based on which column its under. Each page thumbnail represents a project. Simply drag that content into a new column to update the status.

##########################################

- Add propertiesfor every page in your content calendar, you can assign properties that show project-specific information. ClickPropertiesat the top right of your list, then+Add a property. Choose the property type and give it a name. A few examples:Writerfor aPersonproperty to tag someone to complete that task.Deadlinefor aDateproperty to add important dates and stay ahead of deadlines.Typefor aSelectproperty to tag blog posts, videos, social media updates, etc.You could even have aCheckboxproperty calledSEO Checklistto confirm that each piece uses SEO best practices such as structured URLs and keyword-optimized meta descriptions.
* Writerfor aPersonproperty to tag someone to complete that task.
* Deadlinefor aDateproperty to add important dates and stay ahead of deadlines.
* Typefor aSelectproperty to tag blog posts, videos, social media updates, etc.
* You could even have aCheckboxproperty calledSEO Checklistto confirm that each piece uses SEO best practices such as structured URLs and keyword-optimized meta descriptions.
- Create and customize as many properties as you want. Learn all about property typeshere.

##########################################

### 2. Customize your content board further
One size doesnt fit all marketing campaigns. Here's how you can tailor your Notion calendar to fit each project:
- Show properties in your cardssee at a glance what's most relevant to you. Instead of clicking into cards to see their properties, you can display the most relevant information right on cards in your board. In an instant, get a view of the projects your team is working on, who owns them and any other properties you want. On the top right of your calendar, clickand hitProperties. Toggle the ones you want visible in your board view.
- Grouping your board differentlythe columns in your board can be grouped based on a few of the properties you select. Maybe you want to see whos blogging this week, or group the content by type. HitGroup byon the top of your board to change the columns.
- Custom views for different needssave views into your database that match different workflows. On your content calendar, click+Add a viewat the top left. Select the view type. Then name your new view. You can use different filters and sorts to organize the content in this view, making as many different views as you need. Maybe you want to see only work for this weeks product launches, or only your social media content calendar. Make views for each, and you can instantly pull them up whenever you need them.

##########################################

Here are a few custom views recommended for your content calendar
Click to expand
### 3. All your content can live directly in your calendar
Entries in your content calendar can be blog posts, press releases, YouTube storyboards, podcast transcripts or just about anything, really. Every page (represented as a card on your board) can be opened and customized to become whatever you need it to be.
Instead of a bunch of links sending you to the far reaches of the internet to do your work, Notion connects your vital information and documents together.

##########################################

Heres how you can customize pages in a few different ways:
- Headers like your published content, your pages deserve a little visual hierarchy too. Format pages to make them easier to read. Choose fromH1(the largest),H2orH3. Type three dashes in a row to make a page break.
- Drag-and-drop using theicon, move anything around your pages and even create columns. Links, text, images, mp3 files, organize nearly anything however you'd like. Make your Notion page look like your favorite blog.

##########################################

- Pages inside of pages you can nest pages inside of your project pages. Whether it's an archive of previous blog posts or a collection of citations, each can be neatly organized on a page. Type/pageinside of your page to create a subpage to organize everything you need for a piece of content.
- Comments cut down on email threads and keep track of all feedback on any piece of content by adding discussions and comments, and opening them up to your whole team.
### 4. Templates that establish a consistent process
Kick-off any campaigns and streamline content production with templates. Whether its a tweet or a sponsored post, you can make sure your content is on point using specific templates.

##########################################

To create a template, look at the right side of your board and click the down arrow next to the blueNewbutton. Select+New template. A blank page will pop up. This is where you'll create the template once, so you can use it again.
- Creative brief start any campaign on the right foot. Briefs can be especially handy for agencies working with different clients. Under an "Overview"H2header, you can includeH3headers for "Objective" and "Brand Guidelines." Under a "Project"H2header, you can includeH3headers for "Campaign Elements" and "Target Audience." Consider also anH2for "Success Criteria" so your marketing team can track goals.

##########################################

- Outline outline any articles, videos and other content to ensure it hits on all your major points. You can also treat outlines as a collaborative process. Bring other teammates into an outlines development by tagging them. Provide background information on the contents goals. You can include your style guide or reference links, too.

##########################################

- Content-specific pages build out templates depending on the content type to simplify workflows. Create sections in a podcast template page dedicated to interview questions, editing notes, YouTube metadata and recordings. Or put together your shot list, script and other pre-production documents in one handy place starting with a video template page. A blog template can contain content ideas, research, a draft of the article, and all edits.
You can update a base template anytime by clicking the down arrow next toNew. Then click thenext to the template and clickEdit.

##########################################

Notion templates give you the ability to provide clear guidance on your content marketing strategy that your team or a business partner can follow  but once inside, theres still enough flexibility that you or your team can work their way.
## Take it a step further by publishing content
Remember we said you can make Notion pages look like your favorite blog? You can also publish pages to the web for anyone to read.
- When youre ready to share your Notion page with the world, clickShareon the top right.
- Toggle onShare to the web. ClickCopy Linkand anyone with the link can view this Notion page.
- You can also toggleSearch engine indexingto make your page eventually discoverable on Google.

##########################################

Keep in mind you can even use Notion to build a website or resume. Learn howhere.
## Tips from the Notion marketing team
Content Marketer Nate Martins uses this content calendar to collaborate and stay on top of deadlines.
"As a team, we're working on so many different kinds of content. Having it all in one place allows us to have a clear marketing strategy, while views give slices of that based on what we need at any time, he says. Instead of wondering where a draft of something is or when something's going to launch, everyone on our team can go right to the source."

##########################################

Here are a few content management tips from our marketing team:
- Create a view of your marketing calendar in your team's wiki at Notion, we have a view of the content calendar showing content going live this week. We keep it at the top of our team'swikiso we're all aligned on all marketing efforts and what's coming out. This is called a linked database. Learn how to add onehere.
- Relate content and social media databases we have one database for all our content and another for social media. One column in these databases is relational, meaning theyre connected. If were launching a new video, we can see all the tweets, Instagram and LinkedIn posts we plan on publishing to support that video. Learn how to do ithere.
- We have internal and external deadlines (and views for each of these) having both deadlines keeps our eyes on the prize. We're focused on execution, and the internal deadline ensures we're meeting that external due date every time.

# This notes & docs system makes your design team more efficient
Great design teams work with a full field of vision. Without places to collect notes for a product feature spec or from a weekly standup with engineering, important decision-making context might as well live on the backside of a napkin, easily lost and impossible to reference.
The real key is having a system that bakes documentation into everything you do. That prompts you to build knowledge over time so you're always getting better together.

##########################################

Here, we'll walk you through building two note-taking systems tailored specifically to designers in Notion  one for meetings and one for all your documents.As we've seen across dozens of companies using this approach, they'll help your team save time, lead to more in-sync work, and result in a more thoughtfully-designed end product.
### In this piece, you'll learn
- 1To create databases Meeting Notes and Docs, and to use them to unite your team.
- 2To organize these databases with tags so you can quickly find what you need.
- 3Best practices from the Notion design team for high-impact note-taking.

##########################################

## Soon, you'll be able to create documentation for your design system that looks like this:
Your design team needs documentation
Design decisions aren't made in a vacuum. Your Meeting Notes and Docs systems become arenas where you'll share notes and ideas, so that information is transparent, learnings compound, and handoffs are seamless.

##########################################

In Notion, your design team's Meeting Notes and Docs systems can organize:
- Notes from every meeting standups, project syncs and breakouts for smaller groups can be tagged and organized however's best for your team.
- Project proposals share detailed thoughts on how to build a new feature and get fast, written feedback from your team
- Memos, plans and processes if you're updating team structure or augmenting a design process, your team knows exactly where to go to get this information. Think about how you kick off projects for example, you can make sure each one is approached thoughtfully.
How does this help your team?

##########################################

- Increased transparency even if someone wasn't in the room (or the same time zone) for a meeting, they'll feel included and get the context they need to contribute from the notes.
- More effective collaboration understand decision rationales (either from a meeting or for a project), save time, and stay aligned because everyone has the "why" behind the "how."
- Consistent quality when everyone is working off the same playbook, they can solve problems in similar ways and hit a consistent bar.

##########################################

Notion makes it easy to collect, organize and customize this information so your team actually uses it.Instead of doc graveyards or fragmented notes from meetings no one ever looks at again, a documentation system becomes both your long-term and short-term memory, turning writing into clear action.
## Setting up your design team's Meeting Notes & Docs systems
Meeting Notes and Docs are different houses built on the same foundation. Here's how you can create both, with concrete recommendations for designers to get the most out of each one.

##########################################

### 1. One database where everything has its place
Notion offers several different types of databases: tables, boards, calendars, etc. Here we'll use a list database  a sleek, minimalist collection of individual pages, easy to open and label.

##########################################

- Hitting/brings up a menu of options for what you can add to a Notion page  we call this the "slash command."
- To make a list, when youre in a page type/listand scroll down toList - Full pagefrom the options menu. This will create a new page that is only your list and nothing else (you can also show a list inside a page by selectingList - Inline).
- You'll see we've started you off with blank pages in the list. Click on one to edit it, or remove it by hovering over the page and clicking on theicon to the left, and choosingDelete.
- You can hit+ Newto add a new page to the list.
- Try rearranging the pages. Using, grab a page and drag it in whatever order you'd like.

##########################################

You'll create two of these lists, one for Meeting Notes and another for Docs.
The pages in these lists will become weekly design meeting notes, or where designers can submit ideas for product improvements. Anyone on your design team can access them  seeding a culture of transparency and collaboration.
### 2. Organize your notes to find and focus on the right things
For both your Meeting Notes and Docs lists, huge indexes can get unruly.

##########################################

Notion makes them easy to parse and organize. In your Meeting Notes list, maybe you want a view of only standups, or only meetings related to a brand redesign project. In your Docs list, you may want to see the status of a doc as it moves through your process rendered on a Kanban board.You only have to create a database once. Notion makes it possible to view that information any way that's most helpful in the moment.

##########################################

Add sorting and filtering capabilities like this:
- Add properties to your pages inside your list's pages, you'll see properties. These are attributes about each page, like date created, who was in a meeting, what type of meeting it was, etc. ClickPropertiesat the top right of your database to see existing properties and add new ones. For each one, choose the type you want and give it a name. You might use theSelectproperty and call it Type to create tags for "Weekly Standup" in your Meeting Notes list. You can use thePersonproperty to tag all participants.
- Show properties in list view also in thePropertiesmenu, you can decide which ones appear in your list itself. Toggle on the ones you want to show in your list view. With one glance, you'll be able to see things like the type of doc or meeting, who created it and when it was last updated. You don't have to click into any pages to know what's going on.
- Create a filter to see only a sub-segment of your notes or docs that fit certain criteria. ClickFilterat the top right, and hit+ Add a filter. Filter based on the database properties you've created. For example, in your Meeting Notes list, you can filter the Type property to see only retros. In your Docs list, you can filter to see only proposals for new features. The filter is your oyster. You can set it so only pearls float to the surface.

##########################################

- Sort your list to put your pages in a useful order. ClickSort, then+ Add a sort, then choose a property to put in ascending or descending order. This is especially useful if you want to see your Docs arranged from freshest to oldest. Choose theLast editedproperty andDescending. The pages most recently touched will be at the top for easy access.
- Add views you don't have to re-apply a filter or sort every time you want to see certain things in a list. Instead, create a permanent view that you can switch to any time. This also lets you change the format for your data, letting you view it as a table, board, calendar, etc. if you need to. Click+ Add a viewat the upper left corner of your database, choose the format you want, give it a name, and hitCreate.Then apply whatever filter or sort you want. For your design Docs, you can create a list view filtered to only show specs. Or you can make a view to see docs authored by each of your teammates displayed on a board. Most importantly, you can flip back and forth between all of these instantly  just like changing a TV channel.

##########################################

Sorting, filtering and viewing options put the power in your hands to organize your Meeting Notes and Docs lists however's best for you  or another member of your team.You can have views based on an employee or specific team for complete customization of all your notes and docs.
Moreproperties & views for your design Docs

##########################################

Properties can help organize your list of documents and make them more manageable. Here are a few our design team uses:
- Type of doc oneSelectproperty always has "Design." But then we have anotherSelectproperty that drills down further into what type of design document it was, like "UX Research."
- Status anotherSelectproperty, where tags denote what further action is needed on each document. Ours include "Work in Progress," "Open for Comments," and "Implemented."
- Priority aSelectproperty with tags like "Low," "Medium," and "High."

##########################################

Views also make it easy for us to focus on the work in front of us. Here are a few we use:
- By type this is a board view, which groups documents into "Type" columns.
- By author see all the docs created by one of your designers.
- By status another board view that uses the status as the column, grouping your docs by where they're at in your process.
Moreproperties & views for your design Meeting Notes

##########################################

Similarly, properties for your Meeting Notes help denote what type of meeting you had, who was in it, and when it happened. Here are some we use:
- Type of meeting using theSelectproperty, you can create tags based on what type of meeting was held. Try "Design Standup," "Monthly Engineering & Design Sync," and "Retro."
- Participants using thePeopleproperty, tag who was in the meeting.
- Date theCreated timeproperty automatically records the day and time of the meeting. For views, you can leverage all the properties you've included in these notes.

##########################################

Here are a few ways we organize our own Meeting Notes into different views:
- By date created this helps you bring the most recent meetings to the top.
- By type of meeting create different views for the different types of meetings you have. That way, you can see all the meetings about the app redesign you have coming up, or what product features your engineering and design teams decided upon in their monthly meeting.

##########################################

### 3. Customize the pages in your list so they are exactly what your team needs
Notion pages are blank slates  they can be anything, like notes from a full retro on a completed project or a collection of design inspiration. Notion is like a set of power tools, allowing you to build anything you need to help your design team work better.
First, here are a few tips to structure your pages. Notes and docs become ultra-flexible and easy to read with a few small touches.

##########################################

- Headers use these to make your pages neat and tidy, choosing from different sizes likeH1(the largest),H2andH3(the smallest). For a project spec, headers might include Problem statement," "Goals," and "Screenshot examples." For a set of meeting notes, headers might be "Agenda" and "Discussion items."
- Drag-and-drop seriously, you can move anything around in these pages. Hover over what you'd like to move and grab. You can create columns by dragging something all the way to the right (the blue guides will help). For example, if your design team is working on a new dropdown menu, place an example image on the left, and bulleted notes about it on the right.

##########################################

Now, you can incorporate design elements to take your notes to the next level. Remember the slash command? Use it to access a full list of embeds you can include in any page.

##########################################

Here's what might be particularly useful to your design team:
- Images, videos & gifs so you can upload a photo of the whiteboard from a recent brainstorming session or a video explainer about new tools you want to integrate.
- Figma & Invision projects so your team can access design drafts without having to bounce around different software, which is really helpful for gathering feedback from cross-functional teams that can easily use Notion but not other tools.
- Framer prototypes so you can see your design work in action and collaborate with the UX team in once place.
- Whimsical & Miro boards so your design lead can see your thought process in flowcharts or diagrams during a final review.
- Abstract projects so you can see all version histories of a project and pull one out of the archive if necessary.

##########################################

To access these embeds, simply type/and navigate the menu. To get there faster, you can type the name  for example/figmaor/miro.
Context switching, forgetting ideas, siloed info in different tools...these could be things of the past for your design team.Notion's malleability encourages more note-taking  it also makes notes actionable because they can live side-by-side with your actual work.
### 4. Make templates to standardize processes in your lists
For meetings or docs that your team repeats all the time  like weekly standups, or project kickoffs  you can add a re-usable template to your databases.Instead of remaking headers, sections, checklists and more, a template gives you exactly the format you need instantly.

##########################################

To add a template, click the down arrow next to the blueNewbutton on the right side of your list and select+ New template. The blank page that pops up is a template you can define once and use again and again.
Here are a few ideas for templates to use in your Docs and Meeting Notes:
For Meeting Notes

##########################################

- Weekly standups you can create headers for "Agenda" or "Action items," things that'll likely be part of every meeting. Using theSelectproperty type, create a tag for "Weekly Standup." Then using thePersonproperty, tag its usual attendees. Whenever you use this template, everything from the text to the properties will be recreated with a single click.
- Retros & post-mortems again, use aSelectproperty, create a "Retro" or "Post-Mortem" tag. Inside the template, you can have headers for "Problem," "Screenshots," and "Proposed solution," so every problem you encounter is analyzed using the same set of criteria.
- Syncs about specific projects use theSelectproperty to create tags based on the project, like "Website Banner Redesign." ThePersonproperty can be used to tag the meeting's regular participants here too.

##########################################

For Docs
For Docs, templates allow you to put a system in place that's followed by all of your designers, helping standardize processes across the team.

##########################################

- Feature RFC a system we use at Notion called "Request for Comment," which opens up an idea for team commentary. Using theSelectproperty type, create a tag for "Feature RFC." Include headers like "Problem," "Necessary context," "Proposed solution" and "Action items." You can also add text under each of these that includes instructions for your team so everyone can use conduct likeminded analysis.
- Project kickoff your design team will probably have many projects, so this template can help ensure you're all thinking similarly. Use theSelectproperty to create a tag for "Project Kickoff." You can use anotherSelectproperty and leave that blank  this is where you'll create new tags depending on the project. Headers here can include "Goals" with checkboxes underneath, and "Competitor analysis" with a prompt for screenshots.
- User interview it's important to stay connected with your users. Use theSelectproperty to create a "User Interview" tag. Inside the body of the page, add headers for background information, questions asked, responses, and conclusions.

##########################################

### 5. Best practices from the Notion design team for your Meeting Notes and Docs
When asked how Notion manages its documentation system, designer Cory Etzkorn says, Writing documentation is critical for scaling a design system and brand. It makes employee onboarding painless and decision-making more transparent.

##########################################

Documentation is critical to our designers' success  particularly because they sit on different teams. Our Meeting Notes list helps maintain transparency, so everyone can feel like they're involved in a meeting, even if they weren't there. And our Docs list helps our designers collaborate with our product team, because they can share ideas in a single place.Our work becomes more efficient because there's a written account of everything we do.

##########################################

Here are a few tricks we've learned to manage your design team's note-taking system:
- Require documentation in a specific place getting your designers to write everything down will help build a culture of documentation and learning. Whether it's an idea about a product improvement or a quick project sync between engineering and design teams, all this information is valuable. And ensuring all of this has a specific home makes knowledge centrally available to everyone.
- Link to Meeting Notes and Docs from your team's homepage managing everything in Notion lets you create homes for every team in your org. Design canhave its own homepagewith all relevant team info, with pages like "Brand Assets" and "Inspiration." You can link to your Meeting Notes or Docs lists here to make them easily accessible. Drag them from your sidebar into your design homepage or wiki and they become links in the design section of your Notion workspace.
- Drag a page out of your list most documents will stay in your list. But, in your Docs list, if you've created an RFC for a new brand font, got all the feedback, and worked on the project in that page, you can now move it into your team's wiki so everyone can start using it. Useto drag-and-drop this page into another section in your sidebar, or from themenu, selectMove toand choose where you want it to go.

# This project management system connects the dots for your product team
Product managers are the source of truth for every project. But it takes hard work to arrive at that truth. PMs must account for different teams and user research and processes and prototypes, the list goes on. So product teams need a system to centralize all their cross-functional work  not just for them, but to connect and communicate with their many stakeholders.
Here, we'll show you, step-by-step, how to build a project management and roadmapping system in Notion tailored specifically to product managers.We've seen it work for dozens of teams that consistently ship high-quality products faster.
Better databases have arrived!

##########################################

While the concepts outlined in this guide are still useful, references to specific product actions may be a bit outdated! Databases were redesigned in March 2022, so your experience may differ slightly from whats pictured and described here.This guideoutlines the new database features, including what's changed.
### In this piece, you'll learn
- 1To create a database for project management and roadmapping that unites all teams (engineering, design, sales, marketing, etc.) and makes work transparent.
- 2To organize and customize this database to meet your team's needs and surface relevant information.
- 3Best practices from the Notion product team for better project management.

##########################################

## By the end, you'll be able to build aproject management systemthat looks like this:
Your product team needs a better project management system
Whether it's adjusting timelines or gathering feedback from many sources, product managers face a unique set of problems when it comes to project management. If cracks in your system aren't sealed, you might ship something that doesn't meet your quality bar. The most common of these cracks include:
- Dispersed, inaccessible information working cross-functionally, it's difficult to collect and share all drafts, feedback and context that's siloed in tools specific to different functions (think Figma for designers or Jira for engineers).
- Lack of transparency for your team (and org-wide) top-level information, like who owns a project and who's working on it, isn't clearly communicated by your system because there isn't a single place to access it all. This also means those outside the team don't know where to go if they have questions.
- Rigid systems that inhibit your process don't let software's limitations define your process. You should be able to mold software to your needs instead of shoehorning information into it.

##########################################

In Notion, you can create a custom project management and roadmapping system that puts all the information from the teams you're working with front and center.

##########################################

- One place for all project management & work along with knowing the status of a project, everything from notes to design mockups to feedback is in one place, so your team doesn't miss a thing.
- See all important project info at a glance metadata for every project, like owners, deadlines, and sprints can be viewed right in your database, so you get an instant download of where everything stands.
- Customize the system to meet your needs establish a process all your PMs follow while giving them the flexibility to shape how they work individually, leading to more effective work instead of project management overhead.

##########################################

This project management and roadmapping system can be the foundation for your product team's growth.Because Notion is both structured and malleable, the tools you build in it grow with you as you add more teammates or change the way you do things.
## How to set up your product team's project management & roadmapping system
No matter your team's size or the number of projects you're tackling, all your product work starts here. Here's how to set it up, with recommendations tailored to busy PMs.

##########################################

### 1. A board that tracks every project
You can make a number of different databases in Notion: lists, tables, calendars, etc. But here, we'll focus on creating a board, which is a collection of individuals project pages you can move from one stage of a process to the next.

##########################################

- By typing/, you'll get a menu of what you can add to a Notion page. We call this the "slash command," a universal menu of everything you can do in Notion.
- To create your board, type/boardand selectBoard - Full page. A completely new page that's just your board will pop up.
- At the top of your board are columns. You can change these to reflect each phase in your product team's process. We've set you up with the basics: "Not started," "In progress," and "Complete." You can customize them to your specific needs.
- In your board, you'll see a few cards. Each one can be a project. And inside each card, you'll see several different properties, which are important because you'll organize your board based on them. For instance, you can have a date property to capture projects' due dates. You can have a person property to capture stakeholders. You can even add tags to denote which team owns the project or what type of project it is.To add a property to your board, click+Add a property. You'll be prompted to give it a name and choose the type of property you want.You can group your board by any property by clickingat the top right of your board and selectingGroup By. For example, group your board by project owners to see all projects organized underneath the people responsible for them.
* To add a property to your board, click+Add a property. You'll be prompted to give it a name and choose the type of property you want.
* You can group your board by any property by clickingat the top right of your board and selectingGroup By. For example, group your board by project owners to see all projects organized underneath the people responsible for them.
- Go ahead and grab a card and move it from one column to the next. Now visualize yourself moving every project into the "Complete" column. Feels good, right?

##########################################

This board is the foundation for getting things done as a group. Each of its structural components are important to what you're building  columns for your process, cards for project info, properties for organization.
And because all projects live in one place, anyone can see their status. You're creating a window of transparency for both your team and for the entire organization.

##########################################

### 2. Customize your database
Every product team works differently. Using Notion, you can create a project management and roadmapping system that matches your team's workflow. Here are a couple tips for doing that:
- Show properties in your board view instead of clicking into cards to see all their properties, you can display the most relevant ones right on cards in your board. In an instant, you can get a view of the projects your team is working on, their priority, who owns them, and any other properties you want at your fingertips. On the top right of your table, clickand hitProperties. Toggle the ones you want displayed in your board view. To rearrange them, use theicon.
- Create different views Notion allows you to slice the same dataset many ways. You can have a view of your database that's only projects launching this week. You can have one for projects you're collaborating with the design team on. You can have another for only mobile projects. Best of all, you can immediately toggle between them.To do this, click+ Add a viewnear your board's title. Then select the type of database you want, name it, and hitCreate. You can view your board as a table too, or as a calendar showing when you're working on what.You can now apply different filters to surface only information you want and need. ClickFilterthen+ Add a filter. Maybe you want to see only P1 projects related to your desktop app. You can filter to see just those. Then you can hitSortand+ Add a sortto organize them by launch date. Views preserve the filters or sorts you apply, so you don't have to recreate them every time.To switch between views you've created, simply click that same view menu. They're all there! This opens up a lot of potential. Every team your board connects could create a view of just their tasks so they're easier to see. Even individuals could create their own task boards (giving everyone visibility into their priorities).

### 3. Working right inside your project management system
Now that you have a system for managing projects, let's turn our attention to the cards on your board. This is where you'll house all the information related to your projects.

##########################################

Because PMs work so cross-functionally, they juggle every tool used by the teams they're collaborating with.Engineers, designers, and marketers all use unique software. Even feedback is tucked away in these tools, making it hard to find, like buried treasure without a map.
In Notion, all teams, tools, and commentary for a project come together. This creates more effective communication and streamlined work  instead of your PMs shuffling through software to make sure everything is accounted for.

##########################################

- Customize every page every project requires different documentation, organized so it's easy to navigate and use. Notion gives PMs just enough flexibility to arrange information that suits the current task. For instance, by typing/heading, you can select fromH1,H2, orH3headers. Then, using theicon, you can drag-and-drop images, text, sub-pages and more under these headers. This tidies up all the info in pages and makes it digestible.
- Embeds just for product teams bring all your team's tools together in one place for effective work. Engineers can share a code snippet by typing/code. Designers can embed prototypes by typing/figmaor/invision. You can even include a feedback form with/typeform. As a PM, you can create a better, more collaborative working environment because Notion supports many tools your team is using.
- Pages inside of pages you can nest pages inside of your project pages infinitely. Whether it's an archive of previous design iterations from designers, or a collection of user interviews, each can be neatly organized in a page. This gives your product team a way to collect all the information for a project, from spec to launch, and organize it cleanly.
- Real-time feedback using the@symbol, you can tag teammates in comments and discussions to collaborate. Tag a designer to review your new dropdown menu or a copywriter to approve final text. For PMs, collating feedback in one place ensures it's acted upon and that everyone's looped into conversations (especially helpful while remote).

##########################################

Everything about comments and discussions in a 4-minute video here
- Make decisions with full context inside your pages, you can have a living thought process for every step of a project, from old design specs to meeting notes. That way, there's full understanding of why a certain aspect of a project was put on hold, or why one design was chosen over another. You can even include test results or user feedback. With end-to-end clarity of what happened, you can chart the path for what happens next.
Notion gives you the structure to set a process your product team follows  but also enough flexibility that they can work their own way from project to project.

##########################################

### 4. Templates that start every process on the same foot
Your project management and roadmapping system sets the process your product team will follow from a high level. Templates make it even more granular.Every project has a unique set of considerations, and templates help ensure PMs capture them. Define and use the same formats again and again for authoring specs, conducting user interviews, and more.
Templates help create a hive mind for your team, where they're able to operate off the same principles when starting any new process.

##########################################

To create a template, look at the right side of your board and click the down arrow next to the blueNewbutton. Select+ New template. A blank page will pop up. This is where you'll create the template once, then use it repeatedly (don't worry, you can update it whenever).
For product teams specifically, here are a few ideas for templates:
- Project spec used to start any project, this template helps ensure your PMs are considering its entire scope. Under an "Overview"H2header, you can includeH3headers for "Problem Statement" and "Proposed Work." Under a "Dependencies & Risks"H2header, you can includeH3headers for "Stakeholders" and "Risks." You should also have anH2for "Success Criteria" so your product team can track goals.

##########################################

- User interview it's important to maintain a solid relationship with your users. This template helps your product managers get the most from all these interviews. Be sure to include anEmailorPhoneproperty here, so you record the user's contact info. In the body of the template, you can have differentH2headers for "User Feedback," "Interview Observations," and "Action Items." You can even include a list of questions that have proven useful and make them standard across your team.

##########################################

- RFC also called "request for comment," this is a type of page we use at Notion to solicit team feedback. In yourSelectproperty for the project "Type," make a tag for "RFC." You should also have anotherSelectproperty for "Status," where you can add tags for "Open for Comment," "In Progress" and "Archived." Use aPeopleproperty titled "Reviewers" to assign the folks responsible for giving you feedback. You can then create headers for specs or code blocks, and prompt your reviewers to leave comments. When you're ready, share the link to this on Slack with your team.

##########################################

It's easy to see how templates help your team cement processes. But they also help your team grow.New PMs can see how your team works and start following this thought process instantly. And when their fresh eyes see something you forgot to include? You can update any template with a click, and start using it widely.
### 5. Linking all related project work in your cards
One of Notion's most powerful features is the ability to connect information across databases. Using aRelationproperty, you can sync all the meeting notes or tasks related to a project right inside that project's card.

##########################################

This is where Notion shines  once your entire company is using it, you can begin connecting what were once disparate project pieces in a single place. No more searching endlessly for that one document you need. Everything is bundled together for easy access.

##########################################

Here's how to set this up:
- You'll want to make a Task List for either your entire company or specific teams. You can usethis templateto get started. With it, you'll have a list of everyone's tasks, which you can then assign to the larger projects they're related to.
- Another good thing to fold into your projects are all relevant meeting notes.Here's a templateyou can use to make a company (or team)-wide Meeting Notes system. We've also created specific meeting notes & docs recommendations forengineeringanddesignteams.
- Great. Now you have two databases for Tasks and Meeting Notes. In your project management and roadmapping system, add aRelationproperty and title it "Tasks." You'll be prompted to select a database  choose your Task List. Then do the same for Meeting Notes. You'll now be able to link any pages from these databases in your cards.
- Let's say you have a project to improve commenting on your mobile app. You'd go to your Task List and create all the tasks needed to complete that project. Then, in the your card for the Improve Commenting on Mobile project, you can link all the tasks that roll up into that project, like "Comment Suggestions" or "Copy and Paste Capabilities." You can also sync all meeting notes about the project, like from the standup you have with engineering and design teams working on the feature.
- In your Task List or Meeting Notes databases, you can create aRelationproperty titled "Project," which allows you to sync both ways. Whenever you have a meeting, tag the project you talked about in the notes. Any updates you make in the Task List or Meeting Notes databases will be reflected in your project management and roadmapping system.
- Another usefulRelationproperty? "User Research." If you build a separate database to keep track of user interviews, you can connect them to your projects. Anytime you conduct a user interview that might be beneficial for a specific project, just link it inside that project's card so you have full context from the people using it most.

##########################################

### 6. Best practices from the Notion product team
Product designer Ryo Lu uses our project management system to collaborate cross-functionally. "Teams can use project pages as a single source of truth to track projects down to related tasks, docs and notes  all in one place," he says. "Most importantly, this system breaks down team and app silos so everyone in the company has clarity and knows what's going on."

##########################################

Here are a few tips our product team uses to manage projects with a single system:
- Add a view of your project board in your product team's wiki ourproduct team's wikiis its home base. It has all the important documents and information that team needs to work. It's been very helpful to have a view of their projects board at the top of this page, with everything launching each week. This helps with transparency, especially at the company-wide level, and keeps the product team aligned around goals.To add this type of view to your wiki, type/linkand chooseCreate linked database. Then, search for your projects board. After it pops up on your page, click+ Add a view, making a table titled "This Week." You can then filter, choosing your property that denotes ship date, selectingis onorafterandExact date(adjusting this every Monday).
* To add this type of view to your wiki, type/linkand chooseCreate linked database. Then, search for your projects board. After it pops up on your page, click+ Add a view, making a table titled "This Week." You can then filter, choosing your property that denotes ship date, selectingis onorafterandExact date(adjusting this every Monday).
- Feedback tags help prioritize projects Our product team works in lockstep with our customer support team to understand users' problems. To make this possible, the customer support team maintains a database of user feature requests and issues, each tagged by feature, need, or topic. This makes it easy to see which features are the most wanted, and that information gets piped into our product roadmap via aRelationproperty so we can constantly make decisions about what to build next with intuition directly from our customer
- Views for each sub-team our product team is broken down into smaller sub-teams, each responsible for working on different parts of the product, like "Mobile," "Enterprise," and "Infrastructure." Each team has its own page in ourengineering wiki, and inside these pages is a view of our shared projects board, filtered just for initiatives that team is handling. This keeps everyone informed about what's getting done and what's coming next.

# This project management system helps your engineering team track every initiative
The bestproject management systemcatches everything  it communicates who's responsible for what, shows where everything stands, and surfaces dependencies and edge cases.
This is especially true for engineering projects, because they directly impact the entire company. It's essential to have a proven, scalable system to execute these nuanced, complex initiatives. And as your team grows, when engineers are focused on their individual work, they'll also need full knowledge of assignments, timelines, development stages, and scope.

##########################################

Here, we'll walk you through building a project management and roadmapping system tailored specifically for engineers (we use one like it at Notion).As we've seen across dozens of engineering teams, it'll help you track projects, ensure everyone's on the same page, and provide company-wide visibility into your work.
### In this piece, you'll learn
- 1To create a database for project management and roadmapping that's efficient and transparent.
- 2To organize that database with tags and views so you can quickly find what you need.
- 3Best practices from the Notion engineering team for effective project tracking.

##########################################

## Soon, you'll be able to create a roadmap for your engineering projects that looks like this:
Your engineering team needs a system to manage projects
Not only do engineering projects impact the whole company  more importantly, they impact users. Your team is operating in a high-stakes environment.If deadlines slip or buggy products launch, there are major implications internally and externally.

##########################################

In Notion, your team's project management and roadmapping system can:
- Track the status of every project bugs, tasks, sprints and large projects can be easily moved from one stage to the next with complete visibility.
- Organize all the relevant materials for that project in one place all code snippets, notes, images, or prototypes associated with a project are kept in a single place so your team can easily access them.
- Be viewed multiple ways to surface important information slice a roadmap many different ways to show only what you want to see, like which projects an engineer is assigned, or all the bug fixes scheduled to ship this week.
How does this help your team?

##########################################

- Ship fast, ship quality, save time speed is a competitive advantage, so you need a system that'll allow you to maintain speed (and your quality bar) instead of worrying about the logistics of project management.
- Extend your team's capabilities creating a scalable process allows your team to work on more projects with broader impact. And with a customizable roadmap, you can match the workflow to your specific team's needs.
- Transparency, both on your team and company-wide a shared roadmap gives your engineers visibility into what everyone is working on, and the entire company can see the status of projects that relate to their work.

##########################################

## Setting up your engineering team's project management system
Your roadmapping and project management system is a way to see large-scale projects and all the small tasks and materials associated with those projects. Here's how you can create it, with recommendations for engineers to get the most out of it.
### 1. One database for every initiative
In Notion, you can make a few different types of databases: tables, lists, boards, calendars, etc. Here, we'll be using a board  a collection of individual project pages that you can move from one stage of the process to the next.

##########################################

- Hit/to show the full menu of options for what you can do in a Notion page. This is called the "slash command."
- To make a board, type/boardand selectBoard - Full pagefrom the menu. This will create a new page that's just your board.
- You'll see we've started you off with some columns. You can customize these to match your team's workflow. Click on each to change the title, and go to the right and hit+ Add a groupto create a new column.
- You'll also see we've started you off with a few blank pages. These will be your projects. Click one, and you'll see properties associated with it at the top.
- Grab one of the cards and move it along the process. See how good that feels?

##########################################

This board acts as both your roadmap and project management system.You can have everything related to a project within each page, while also tracking its progress. This helps save engineers time bouncing between apps that simply point you to the work  Notion keeps it all in one place.
### 2. Organize projects & customize how you see them
Before helping you organize your projects, we wanted to touch on a system that's been super beneficial for our engineering team.
We organize our projects in epics, tasks, sprints, and bugs.
-  Epics are large, overarching initiatives.
-  Tasks are actions that make up epics.
-  Sprints are time-specific pushes to complete a set of tasks.
-  Bugs are specific types of tasks to fix things.

##########################################

These will become tags that connect everything your engineering team is working on. For example, if an epic is improving mobile startup time, in that page, you can see all the tasks associated with it, like rebuilding the share sheet on iOS and Android.This keeps everything related to a specific project in one place so you don't miss anything.More on this below.
But first, here's some tips for how to set up your project management and roadmapping system.

##########################################

- Add properties to your pages inside your board's pages, you'll see properties. These are attributes you assign to each page, like the date it was created, the PM, or the type of project. Click on a property and selectProperty Typeto see options for properties. Use aSelectproperty and name it "Type" to create tags for "Epic," "Sprint," "Tasks" and "Bugs." Use aPersonproperty to tag the engineers on the project. Use aDateproperty to select the ship date. Use aMulti-selectproperty to tag different sprints these tasks will fall into.
- Show properties in the board view this will help you get a bird's eye view of everything in your board from metadata. Near the top right of your board, selectProperties. This will bring up all the properties you've put in your cards. Toggle each one you want to display in the board view. You can even grab theicon to re-order how they're shown on the cards.
- Change the grouping of your board on the upper right of your board, you'll see aGroup bybutton. With it, you can change the columns on your board to any of theSelect,Multi-select, orPersonproperties you've added to cards. For example, you can group by engineers to see who is working on what. You can group by sprint to see the tasks in each sprint. You can group by priority to see what project you should tackle next.
- Add views with Notion, you have the ability to display one set of information in many different ways. Maybe you want a calendar of when epics will ship or a table of all the bugs your team is working on. To do this, hit the+ Add a viewnext to the title of your table, select the type of database you want, and hitCreate. You can then apply different filters and sorts to customize further. Let's say you want a table of your highest-priority bugs. Create a table view, then selectFilterand then+ Add a filter. You can now choose the type property as bug, and only bugs will show up in the table. To sort, selectSortthen+ Add a sort, then select the priority and make is ascending.

##########################################

Notion makes it easy to customize how you see your entire collection of projects.Whether it's information for a certain project or a calendar of your largest initiatives, Notion puts the power in your hands. This unlocks both granular and high-level tracking of your projects where you can get a complete download of everything at a glance.

### 3. Collecting all your tasks for a project in one place
Using aRelationproperty, you can show every task related to a project in that project's card.

##########################################

Let's say you're adding in-line emojis to your product. You'd create an epic for that project. Then, you'd create a number of tasks needed to complete that project  like emoji autocomplete and emoji tooltips. Inside the card for the in-line emoji epic, you'll see every task, so your team can stay organized and efficient.
Here's how to set it up.

##########################################

- Create an epic this should be a big project you're working on, like "In-line emojis."
- Create an epicRelationproperty in that card, select+ Add a propertyand chooseRelation(don't forget to name it "Epic"). A list of all your databases will appear. Search for the database you're currently in. After selecting it, you'll be given two options for the type of relation you want to create. ChooseCreate a new property. This makes your relation sync both ways, so that you can assign a task to an epic, or assign an epic to a task.
- Create a taskRelationproperty following the same steps above, create another relation property, connect it to the same database and call it "Tasks."
- Connect a task to an epic now you're ready to create a task. Using our example above, create a card for "Emoji tooltips." Using the "Epic" property, select your "In-line emojis" epic.
- Open the card to see all the tasks in your "In-like emojis" epic card, you should see all the tasks that have been assigned to it. You can add as many tasks as necessary to get the job done.

##########################################

Relation properties unite all your work. So if you have a big, complicated project that requires many tasks and engineers responsible for them, you'll be able to collect and organize them all in a single place for greater efficiency.
### 4. Work right inside your project management system
You now have the framework for your project management and roadmapping system. Each one of the pages in this board will also house all the elements of each epic, task or bug.
Instead of bouncing between software, your engineers can work, give feedback and connect all their tools in one place using Notion.

##########################################

- Customize every page different projects require different documentation, each arranged so they're easy to navigate. Notion gives you just enough structure so that you can organize information however best fits the task at hand. Create headers inside of pages by typing/heading. Then, make columns by grabbing theicon and dragging and header all the way to the right. Using theicon, drag-and-drop text, images, videos and more under those headers for a neat and tidy page that's easy to digest.
- Embeds just for engineers engineers use a unique set of tools to get their work done. Notion brings all of them together. Type/codeto include a code snippet right in your page, like when you're launching new mobile and tablet controls and want to see if the code looks right to your team. Or you can share a GitHub gist by typing/gist. You can even include an/imageor/videoto show those new controls in action right in the page.

##########################################

Watch our 3-minute video that teaches you everything you need to know about code blocks here

##########################################

- Pages inside pages You can keep all documentation related to a project neatly inside it. Just add them as sub-pages with/page. Add infinite layers of pages to capture all the information you need to complete anything, and give yourself and your team clear pathways to find everything in your sidebar by opening the toggles.
- Feedback in real time use the@symbol to mention one of your teammates to get feedback on a project. A fellow engineer can make some notes in your code. A designer can provide comments on a Figma file you've embedded of the new dropdown menu. Normally, designers and engineers would be siloed in their own tools. Instead, Notion connects cross-functional teams for tight feedback loops.
- Decisions made with full context inside pages, you can have a running thought process for every aspect of a project. Include notes about why a task got de-prioritized or why your team changed the code guidelines on mobile. You can even include test results inside these pages to put some data muscle behind your decision-making framework. Notion gives you full clarity of what happened and what needs to happen next.

##########################################

When project work and project management happen in the same place, you don't need to worry about anything slipping between the cracks  you have one system, so no cracks exist.
Everything you need to know about comments and discussions in 4 minutes.
### 5. Templates standardize your processes
In your project management system, you can create templates unique to each problem an engineer will tackle.

##########################################

Templates help engineers approach problems the same way every time. This leads to a consistent problem-solving approach that saves time and builds strong institutional knowledge.For example, in a bug report, you'll have headings prompting your engineers to get screenshots and replicate the bug  this helps surface what information you'll need to find an answer faster.
To add a template to your board, click the down arrow next to the blueNewbutton on the right side of your database and select+ New template. A blank page pops us where you can create the template once and use it over and over again.
Here are a few ideas for templates your engineering team can use

##########################################

### 6. Best practices from the Notion engineering team
When asked about our engineering team's project management and roadmapping system, engineer Sarah Lim says, "A good task management system adapts to a team's knowledge and processes."
She continues, "Relations allow us to associate heterogeneous entities. A set of tasks can be related to a project, which in turn relates to meeting notes and design documents. The result is a system that captures what's happening and how all of the constituent pieces fit together."

##########################################

Here are a few tips we've learned for managing our engineering project management system:
- Create a linked version of your database for engineering sub-teams if you have sub-teams, it's a great idea to create a database view that's only their tasks and projects. Inside yourengineering wiki, each team can have their own page, like one for your infrastructure and platform teams. At the top of the page can be a version of the project management and roadmap system that's filtered just to show the infrastructure team's epics. This helps encourage focus without losing transparency for what the eng team at large is working on.
- Link your meeting notes to your project management system just like tasks are linked to epics, you can also link allmeeting notesto your epics. Create anotherRelationproperty and link it to a meeting notes database. That way, you can have every discussion about a project cataloged along with its tasks. This type of asynchronous communication helps foster transparency and keep everyone in the loop, even engineers who weren't in the room during the meeting.
- Assign a clear owner for every epic and task make twoPersonproperties in your epics and tasks, one for the project owner and another for the team responsible for executing it. By having a clear owner, anyone who has a question about the project knows who to ask. This makes for clear, streamlined, cross-functional communication.

# Three key databases for teams, and how to use them
Databases are powerful, digital filing cabinets where you can organize pages and add layers of information to each item. Instead of your documents getting lost in hidden folders, databases give everyone visibility into whats happening across the company. You have the flexibility to view your information in different ways and create context-specific filters and views.
And, if you need a doc or a task to show up somewhere else, theres no need to copy and paste plain text. You can resurface information dynamically across the workspace, wherever its relevant.

##########################################

Want to view all your teams tasks for the week grouped by the assignee, standardize and speed up documentation, or design a project dashboard uniting all relevant meetings, documents, and tasks?
You can do all this and more with three databases that are essential for every team: Meeting Notes, Docs, and Tasks & Projects
Weve created templates for all three of these databases, which are linked below. You can copy them straight into your workspace and theyll be ready to use with your team. This will be rolling out to all users in the coming weeks. If you dont yet see it in your workspace, you will soon!
Go straight to the templates
Check out our in-app template pickerhere.

##########################################

## Easily surface information in three essential databases
If youre using Notion for knowledge management, you might be keeping everything from last weeks all-hands meeting notes to the product teams latest project scope and quarterly OKRs somewhere in your workspace.
We show you how to create an easy-to-navigate company wiki, with top-level pages and sub-pages living within themhere. But, youll also need databases if you want to avoid a cluttered workspace, where team members have to dive into pages within pages to find what theyre looking for.
Lets take a closer look at how you could use Meeting Notes, Docs, and Tasks & Projects databases in your company workspace.

##########################################

### 1. Meeting Notes
If everyone who attends a meeting jots down their own disconnected notes, theres no guarantee youll leave with clear takeaways. Plus, its not easy to refer back to what was said.
A meeting notes database will help your team become more methodical about note-taking. Meetings stay on track, and everyone knows the next steps.

##########################################

Here are some things you can do with your meeting notes database:
- Use properties to categorize meetings Add a meeting date, and use aPersonproperty to tag all attendees. With aSelectproperty, add meeting type tags to indicate whether its a standup, weekly sync, etc.
- Choose a list layout sorted by date SelectSort, byDate, andDescendingto view the most recent meetings first.
- Group or filter according to meeting type If you want to review notes from the design teams recent meetings, you can group the database by meeting type or attendees. You can then save those filtered views to come back to in future.
- Take meeting notes inside the database entry When a new meeting takes place, simply create a new item in the database, fill in relevant properties and start taking notes.
- Use templates to speed up note-taking and improve accuracy Set up a template for each different kind of recurring meeting. Inside the template, have key properties already filled out where possible. Add some page content like bullet points, a checklist and some useful headings so you can jump straight into note-taking as the meeting begins.

##########################################

### 2. Docs
Clear documentation results in greater transparency and gives everyone accountability for their work. Your docs database can become the single source of truth for company information. You can have one docs database for the whole company, and then create synced views within each departments teamspace.

##########################################

Here are some tips for using your docs database:
- Add dimensions of information to each document Documents in your docs database are much more than just pages stored in folders. With properties, you can add more context compared to a regular document, from dynamic properties like created date and last edited date, to select properties to label documents and status property to tag docs as In Progress, Complete, etc.
- Create templates for often-used documents Fill out properties and add an outline of page content so you never have to draw up a technical spec, architecture overview, or project scope from scratch.
- Format documents aesthetically Inside the page, you can organize text into columns, headers, bullets, checklists, images, embeds, and more. Its up to you to design your documents however makes the most sense. You can even embed databases within the page, or sync content from other tools like GitHub and Jira.

### 3. Tasks & Projects
Task and project management is a breeze if you use a database to track all your teams to-dos.
Tasks & Projects are two related databases that work together to help you connect the dots between daily jobs to do and larger objectives.

##########################################

Heres how you can manage your tasks and projects in Notion:
- Add new tasks as separate entries into the database Make sure to enter all tasks into your database to ensure nothing ever slips through the cracks.
- Tag each task with properties Status property, assigned, and due dates can help you see what tasks need to be done, and by who.
- Select a project for each task Projects are made up of a series of tasks. Create a separate database for tasks, and use a relation property to connect them. That way, you can attach tasks to relevant projects, and you can see how close your projects are to completion.
- Group tasks by project, assignee, or due date Easily see all tasks by their corresponding project or due date. Grouping tasks by assignee is a great way to see what each of your team members has on their plate.
- Use a progress bar to show project completion You can add a satisfying progress bar to show how close you are to completing your projects. First, add a  rollup property to your projects database. When you edit the relation, choose Tasks, and select the status property. Then, select Calculate percent per group and choose complete.  Now, whenever you move tasks into completed youll see your progress bar move closer to 100%.
- View ongoing projects on a timeline See how different project commitments cross over by creating a timeline view of projects. Make sure your projects have a start and end date so you can visualize their duration.

##########################################

## Customize databases to see what you need, when you need it
Creating a database is easier that you might think. While you can start from scratch, we've simplified the process with pre-selected properties to get you going quickly. To get started-
- Open a new page and clickDatabaseat the bottom of the page.
- From there, you have the option to start from scratch or build with AI.

##########################################

Let's say you want to build a simple project tracker to monitor your team's key initiatives this quarter. Select "Projects" from the suggested databases. You'll then be presented with options to select or deselect the most relevant properties for your database. Pick and choose the ones that make sense for your team - you can always adjust them later. Just like that, you've got your project tracker ready to go!
Whether you have something specific in mind or want inspiration, you have plenty of options - from popular templates to AI-guided setup. Now that youre all set up, lets dive into some database to help you get your database up and running in your workspace.

##########################################

### Every item in a database is a fully editable page
To add a new page to a database click+ Newat the bottom or theNewbutton at the top right. This creates a new, fully customizable page that lives inside the database. You can tag this page with intelligent properties according to the structure of the database.
You can also create page templates inside the database to help you speed up and standardize your work.

##########################################

To create a template, just clickNew template. Anything you add to this page will be saved as a template that you can recreate automatically in the future. Include any information that you want to appear every time, whether its properties you want to fill out or page content like headers, bullet lists, or prompts. You can create various templates for each database so you dont always have to create pages from scratch.

##########################################

### Use properties to add dimensions of information to pages
Properties allow you to categorize database entries in just about any way you can imagine. Basic properties allow you to add text, numbers, custom tags, person tags, dates, and more. With advanced properties you can relate one database to another, pull through specific information from another database, and even build custom formulas.
Full a full list of database properties and learn more about themhere.
Choose from customizable pre-built properties
Click to expand
### View information in different ways
To customize a database layout, go to the options menu () and selectLayout. Here you can choose between table, list, board, calendar, or timeline layouts.

##########################################

- Tables give you an overview of all your documents Tables are the default database layout and theyre great for large sets of information, or when you want to see everything in a database.
- Lists are a simplified way to view items For an uncluttered view of your recent meeting notes, you could use a list database.
- Board view can help keep track of your teams tasks Kanban board databases are ideal for project or task management. You can group the board database by the status property, so you easily move cards across from In Progress to Done for example.
- View launch or publish deadlines on a calendar Calendar layouts are useful when you want to see database entries plotted by date. You can use a calendar to see when content goes live or when new features are due for release.
- Timelines let you visualize your workload and deadlines If youre managing a team, timelines can be a helpful way to look at projects because you can see how much you have on your plate at any one time.

##########################################

You dont have to decide on just one layout per database. One database can contain multiple views. To add a new view, click+next to the current view, and you can add a different layout. you can then switch between different database views using the tabs at the top of your database.
Learn more about database views
To learn more about database views and how they can be used, check out thisvideo guide.

##########################################

### Create contextual views
As your database grows, you need a way to view information thats relevant to different situations. By using filters, you can display subsets of information based on properties. So, if you want to view documents related to a certain project, or notes from all of last weeks meetings, you can use filters to show these entries, and hide everything thats not relevant.

##########################################

To quickly filter your database, clickFilterand choose the property you want to filter by. Here are some examples of ways you might filter databases:
- View all meetings that took place in the last week Use a date filter to view all meetings that took place during the last week, tasks due this week, or content to be published in the next month.
- See all tasks in progress Filter by status to only show tasks that are currently tagged In Progress.
- Filter to see one type of document Use a filter to show only certain types of documents.
- View tasks assigned to you Filter by person to see all tasks assigned to you, or meetings you attended.
- Focus on high-priority tasks Display only projects or tasks that youve marked as priority.

##########################################

If you want to apply more than one filter, you can also selectAdd advanced filter. From here you can add as many filters as you need.
So, you could filter your tasks database to show all tasks that due this week, assigned to you, and ready to start.
### Use groups and sorts to arrange information
You can group together items based on properties, so you could separate items in the database by status, assignee, due date, document type, and more.
In a board view, grouping changes how the cards are arranged on the board. When you group a table, youll see that the database splits into sub-tables according to groups.

##########################################

Another way to organize information in a database is through sorting. You can sort entries in a database to put them in order of date created, due date, or sort alphabetically according to titles or tags.
### Save views to display filtered sets of information
Now, to combine the power of filters and views, you can create multiple views in a single database, each filtered to show a different set of information.

##########################################

Then, you can tab across your database to view different information depending on what you need to see.  For example, within one database you can have:
- An overall view of everything in the database This could be a table database filtered to show all tasks not marked Done.
- A kanban board grouped by status You can easily drag tasks across from In Progress to Done in a board view layout.
- A weekly view of everything due this week A list view filtered by date can show everything you need to get done this week.
- A personal view of items assigned to youFocus on your own to-do list by filtering to show only items assigned to you.

##########################################

### Bring together data from different sources into one block
To create another view of a database anywhere in the workspace, hit / and choose Linked view of database. Instead of creating a view from scratch, you can choose an existing data source to import.
Linked database views allow you to bring relevant information across into different areas of the workspace without duplicating your work. You can create contextual views of a database with custom filters and views applied.
You can even bring source data from various databases to display as different views in the same database block. This allows you to create dashboards to view relevant information side by side.

##########################################

To create a project dashboard, you could create one database block which unites all the tasks, documents, and meeting notes related to that project, which would appear as different views in the same database.

# Take these three steps before onboarding your team to Notion
When teams try to shoehorn their processes into rigid tools, something usually breaks  information is lost, time is wasted, work is incorrect or repetitive. When a tool is flexible, it enables customization to the needs of specific teams, helping them work and collaborate more efficiently.
We see this all the time in how different teams within a company use Notion, whether thats an engineering roadmap or a marketing content calendar. Each workspace is unique and entirely molded to the needs of that team.

##########################################

But before they start building on Notion, the most successful teams take a moment to consider what Notion can do for them. This helps you build better systems and workflows that match the vision you have in your head.
## 1. Understand how you want to use Notion
Because Notion is so versatile, its important to internally define how you want to use it  and align on what you want to accomplish with Notion.

##########################################

- Define your goal of using Notion whether Notion is new to your org or youre looking to expand, its important to understand why youre using the tool. Maybe teammates dont have clarity into company goals, so youre bringing on Notion to create better internal alignment. This sets you up for the next point.
- Discuss what you want to build with it after goal-setting, think about the system that will help you accomplish those goals. This doesnt have to be specific to Notions features yet. It can simply be something like, creating a hub where all employees can see companys goals by quarter. Knowing what you want will help you better get there.
- Think about how your teammates will use it Notion gets more powerful through collaboration. Understanding how different teams / individuals will plug in gives you a better idea of what to build and what you can accomplish. Will it be just your team using Notion? How many people? Will it be a cross-functional hub? Think about Notions role not only in your organization as a whole, but also the people using it.

##########################################

## 2. Think about your toolstack, know where Notion fits in
Your company is likely using many different tools to get work done. The average companyuses 88 of them. Knowing what tools you have, what they do, and which teams use them can help you understand where Notion will fit in.

##########################################

As youre considering your tech stack and Notions place in it, here are a few things to think about:
- Notion works best as a central hub for your tool ecosystem your reliable and up-to-the-minute source of truth. Use it to organize your company knowledge, connect content with context, and provide a dedicated space for each team to think, plan, and create while staying connected.
- Notion can enhance many existing tools for example, you might use Slack to call attention to an important project you built on Notion, and then integrate a Loom video at the top of your project brief to share quick context and summary.
- Notion can be the connective tissue between disparate toolsNotions APIandembedsallow you to bring information that lives in different tools together in Notion. This helps teams collaborate because they all come to one place for information about a project, instead of needing to grant access or learn how to navigate many tools.

##########################################

Heres how you can think aboutwhere Notion fits into your tool ecosystem.
## 3. Teach people the basics to set them up for success
Theres a lot you can do in Notion, but you can also unlock a ton of functionality with just a few basics. By giving your teams a couple of core skills, youll be able to help them understand how to get the most out of the tool.

##########################################

- Notion is built on blocks. Everything is a block! Text, headers, bullets, images, video. You can move them around the page too, using drag and drop.
- Remind teammates that theres no correct way to do things. The best way to use Notion is to explore the power of its flexibility and experiment with whats possible.
- Go step-by-step through a common use case.Heres all our templates. Pick one, and show them how you might move cards through a Kanban board,like this project management system.
- Have your team complete theNotion 101 series, which will give them all the basic functionality they need (and them some!).

# Timeline view unlocks high-output planning for your team
Deadline-driven teams can use timeline view to plot their tasks and projects chronologically  giving you one place to see scope and deadlines, while maintaining the ability to adjust them when things (inevitably) come up along the way.

##########################################

Timeline is another database view you can use to visualize the same information in many ways. It builds on the classic Gantt chart, only with far more flexibility and customization. As one example, you might have one database containing all your engineering projects, with a timeline view showing how long theyll take to build and when theyll launch. And all those project pages in the timeline can be structured however you want or based on the projects needs.
## Removing the blind spots from project management
Rigidproject management softwaredoesn't afford real-life flexibility. It's difficult to change things, and when you do, it's a job in itself for project managers to communicate these changes and foresee all the cascading consequences.

##########################################

Timeline view fixes this by giving your team:
- Flexibility to view projects and adjust them as needed whether a project takes a month or a task takes two hours, you can see everything happening in one place. And when you need to shift course? Easily re-scope or move the entire thing.
- Full understanding of concurrent tasks and prioritization parallel work streams help your team maintain shipping cadence. Like a Gantt chart, timeline view shows you the overlapping nature of your projects or tasks, allowing you to prioritize P0 work.
- Customizable views based on schedules or project elements get as granular or as high-level as necessary. See tasks by the week or the entire month, all with the relevant information you need.

##########################################

And if you'd like to see them an entirely different way, switch to table, board, list, or calendar view. You can always slice and dice your projects however is most helpful to you. Project managers may love timeline views Gantt capabilities, while designers want to see their work on a board.
- Pages in your timeline are a blank canvas for any project every page in your timeline can be fully customized to store all the information related to that project, like images, video, to-do lists, and documentation.

##########################################

## How to use timeline view
Since timeline view is a type ofdatabase view, some elements will likely be familiar. Just like other database views, you can:
- View properties in your timeline by hitting, selectingProperties, and using the eye icon to indicate what you want to see. You can show all, hide all, and add or delete properties in this same menu.
- Filter and sort based on your needs, like to see only projects you're working on this week.

##########################################

However, some elements of timeline view will have that new car smell. Even for frequent users of Gantt charts, you'll have more features with timeline view. Here's how to use them:
- Every page needs a date to be seen on a timeline, pages need aDateproperty. Pages added to a database with timeline view will automatically contain a defaultDateproperty you won't be able to delete.
- Using end dates & times to scope an extended project, in yourDateproperty, add anEnd date. You can even toggle onInclude timewithin a date to get more granular.

##########################################

- Drag-and-drop to move projects or extend them move all the pages on your timeline however's necessary, whether that's pushing a task until tomorrow, or dragging one side of a project page to give yourself an extra week to complete it. You can even shift projects up or down if you want to re-prioritize.

##########################################

- Combining a table with your timeline when you create your timeline layout, you can toggle onShow table. This puts a table on the left side of your timeline view, where you can see certain attributes of your pages based on the properties you select. You can change this at any time in your view options menu underLayoutorProperties. Maybe in your table youd have the engineering sub-team working on the project and the project owner. Then in your timeline, youd have the dates of the project scoped out.

##########################################

- Choose how you want to see the calendar instead of the fixed timeline of a typical Gantt chart, you might need different timelines on which to view your work (like tasks for the day or big projects over the course of a month). To the left of< Today >, you'll see where you can change the view of your timeline. Hours, days, weeks, quarters, years. You choose.
- Organize your timeline by any date you need in themenu, underLayout, you can selectTimeline byto see the availableDateproperties by which to organize your timeline. You might have one view with anEnd datefor two-week sprints, or another that's only launch dates.

##########################################

Timeline puts the dates of a project or a task front-and-center, so everyone knows what to be working on when, and your whole team can drive toward shipping on time.
## Get started with these timeline templates

# Transforming content blocks in Notion
- Turn your content blocks into other types of content blocks to clarify and organize the information you store in your workspace.
- You can turn a to-do into a bullet point by typing the forward slash key, followed byturnbullet.
- Turn a paragraph into a callout block using theturncalloutcommand.
- TheTurn into pagefeature allows you to transform a block into a separate page and choose its location in your workspace.Multiple content blocks can be turned into pages and nested elsewhere in the workspace.
* Multiple content blocks can be turned into pages and nested elsewhere in the workspace.
- Highlight a block and use the formatting toolbar to transform it into different content types.
- Click on the six-dot icon to access theTurn intooption and select your preferred content type.
- These techniques help create clear and rich content faster, making your content more organized and easier to navigate.

# Two note taking systems to make your engineering team more transparent & productive
High-output engineering teams make good documentation a habit. They take detailed notes in meetings so that every decision has context. They attack problems methodically in writing. They solicit feedback asynchronously to get to the best solutions.
The problem with documentation is that  in the absence of a system  it can be a lot. A lot scattered across multiple tools, folders, repositories, emails, and uncategorized Google Docs. What's lost can't be learned from. It can't make your team stronger.

##########################################

That's why we're sharing these two tools.Our team uses them, as do dozens of others, to give notes structure, make them easy to find, and  most importantly  make them useful.
### In this piece, you'll learn
- 1Build a Meeting Notes database to give everyone time-saving, morale-boosting visibility
- 2Build  Docs to make all your specs, proposals, research, etc. collaborative and searchable
- 3Customize both to your team's needs and workflows

## Here's how your notes and docs could look:
Why good notes are a competitive advantage for engineers
What earns someone the coveted title of "10x engineer"? They ship with speed and quality. Not just sometimes  consistently. This requires repeatable systems for higher order thought.
Good notes help you go faster

##########################################

- They're easy to find so you don't waste time hunting for information.
- They're structured so you can extract value with a quick skim.
- They give you a record of what's been tried and what works  so you don't duplicate effort.
Good notes make your work better
- They capture your ideas so nothing gets forgotten.
- They give you a place to think deeply about problems, implications, edge cases.
- You can share to get clear feedback from the right people.
When note-taking is foundational to your engineering culture, you 10x your team's productivity. In a world where the fastest team that delights users wins, this is nontrivial.

##########################################

## Build meeting notes for transparent record keeping
Meeting notes make every standup, sync, and session impactful for your entire team when they follow these rules:
- Good meeting notes are comprehensive and action oriented.They make it possible to go back and consult any conversation. And they surface to-do's that propel your team forward.
- They're organized so anyone can reference them.New employees, teammates out sick, or people from marketing or support can understand them and why they matter.
- They're open and central so no one is left in the dark.Engineers don't distract each other with questions that already have answers, and there are no politics around who knows what.

##########################################

Ok, so they're helpful. But how do you build a good home for them?

##########################################

### Create your database
Here are best practices for setting up your meeting notes:
- Create a list database Add a new page in your sidebar and chooseListfrom the menu. It's the most minimalist database view for easy focus. Every page inside it can be a meeting.
- Add properties For every set of notes, you can assign properties that show attributes like when the meeting took place, who was there, and what type of meeting it was.ClickPropertiesat the top right of your list, then+ Add a property.Choose the property type and give it a name, likeParticipantsfor aPersonproperty to tag who was there, orDatefor aCreated timeproperty that adds a time stamp, orTypefor aSelectproperty to tag standup, weekly sync, sprint planning, post mortem, etc. You could even have aSelectproperty calledTeamif you wanted to tag meetings by engineering sub-team  like mobile, desktop, internal tools, etc.Create and customize as many properties as you want.Learn about all property types.
* ClickPropertiesat the top right of your list, then+ Add a property.
* Choose the property type and give it a name, likeParticipantsfor aPersonproperty to tag who was there, orDatefor aCreated timeproperty that adds a time stamp, orTypefor aSelectproperty to tag standup, weekly sync, sprint planning, post mortem, etc. You could even have aSelectproperty calledTeamif you wanted to tag meetings by engineering sub-team  like mobile, desktop, internal tools, etc.
* Create and customize as many properties as you want.Learn about all property types.
- Hide/show properties Only view the properties you want to see in your list. Maybe you only want to see date and time created. ClickPropertiesagain and switch on the ones you want.

##########################################

### Add views for teams or projects
Notion makes it possible to view the same database many ways  as a table, Kanban board, calendar, filtered by properties, etc. You can add multiple versions of your information in one place and switch between them instantly. No need to re-create content or re-apply filters.

##########################################

- Click+ Add a Viewat the top left of your meeting notes list.
- Choose the type of view you want to add. For example, chooseBoardto see your notes grouped by meeting type or by sub-team.
- Or chooseListagain and apply a filter. Let's say you want a list of only weekly syncs. Create a new list view, then hitFilterat the top right and set the Type property to Weekly Sync. Now you can toggle between all meetings and just syncs. Do the same thing to filter out meeting notes from before a certain date (a nice way to archive old docs).
In this 4-minute video, we cover everything you need to know about database filters.

##########################################

### Create templates for every meeting type
A note-taking system is only as good as the notes it contains. The highest utility notes have clear sections with headings, record who said what, break out a checklist of action items, and provide enough context so anyone can understand what took place without asking.
In Notion, you can use database templates to generate the right format for every type of meeting:
- To add a template, click the down arrow to the right of the blueNewbutton at the top right.
- Choose+ New Templateand add the structure you want in the page that comes up  whatever headers or properties you want when you create a new meeting next time.
- Next time you add a meeting, click that same dropdown and choose the template you want.

##########################################

For engineering team meetings, here are some suggested templates:
- Daily StandupsAdd all the usual participants in that property field  they'll appear there automaticallyAdd the Standup tag in the Type propertyIn the body of the page, add fourH2headings:What did we do yesterday?What are we doing today?Potential blockers?Action items (with a checkbox underneath)
* Add all the usual participants in that property field  they'll appear there automatically
* Add the Standup tag in the Type property
* In the body of the page, add fourH2headings:What did we do yesterday?What are we doing today?Potential blockers?Action items (with a checkbox underneath)
> What did we do yesterday?
> What are we doing today?
> Potential blockers?
> Action items (with a checkbox underneath)

##########################################

- Sprint PlanningAdd the Sprint Planning tag in the Type propertySample headings:Sprint Goal  What you want the sprint to accomplishSprint Backlog  Items you're committed to working on during the sprintTeams & Roles  Scope of responsibility for each personNotes  For the content of the meeting you captureConsider adding one line of text under each explaining what the section is for in grayTo assign responsibility use@to mention the name of the owner
* Add the Sprint Planning tag in the Type property
* Sample headings:Sprint Goal  What you want the sprint to accomplishSprint Backlog  Items you're committed to working on during the sprintTeams & Roles  Scope of responsibility for each personNotes  For the content of the meeting you capture
> Sprint Goal  What you want the sprint to accomplish

> Teams & Roles  Scope of responsibility for each person
> Notes  For the content of the meeting you capture
* Consider adding one line of text under each explaining what the section is for in gray
* To assign responsibility use@to mention the name of the owner

##########################################

- Post MortemAdd the Post Mortem tag in the Type propertySample headings:User facing impact  How did this incident affect users and how many?Timeline  How did the project or issue unfold and who responded?Relevant metrics - Paste in graphs, links to Slack threads, etc.Notes  Actual discussion during the meetingCause analysis  Dig deep into why the incident happened.Resolution  How was the incident resolved? What did we do well in response? What can we do better next time?Future work  How do we prevent this incident in the future? If a short-term fix was implemented, what is the long-term fix?Consider adding a table of contents with/tocat the top. These notes can get quite long and this lets you jump to the part you need.Add text under each heading to explain what that section is for so more people can use this system on their own.

##########################################

Each of these setups is designed to push your team to think deeply, communicate regularly, stay aligned around goals, and help each other improve  as engineers and as a group.
## Build a docs database for your processes, policies & plans
There's a second type of note taking we'll cover here. We'll call these as Docs  writing that codifies policies, proposes changes, specs out features, reviews tool options, sets rules for the codebase, provides guidance, and more.

##########################################

Examples include:
- Better error reporting  A proposal for a new process
- Full stack engineer onsite interview  A rundown of questions to ask candidates
- Testing for infrastructure team  A description of the testing framework
- Architecture brainstorm  Evaluating all options to scale a feature
- Engineering manager transitions  A doc about how promotions work
Just like an office is a physical environment that defines your work, these docs provide a digital environment that does the same. Reading through these can teach any newcomer how you operate, what's important to you, decisions you've made and why.
Now, here's how to build this open book for engineers past, present and future.

##########################################

### Make a Docs list
- Just like you did for meeting notes above add a new list database to your workspace.
- Your properties should be different. Use them to capture more metadata that will be helpful about each doc. We suggest:Type Selectproperty labeling the document as a certain type, i.e. Technical Spec, Project Kickoff, Architecture Overview, Request for Comment (a.k.a. RFC - more on this soon), Planning, Reporting, Research, Data Analysis, etc.Status Selectproperty indicating whether further action is needed on the doc.

##########################################

### Views to visualize your workflow
There are a few database views that are especially helpful for engineering Docs:
- By Type Create a Board view grouped into columns by Type so you can see how many docs are in each category. Easily access all team policies, all specs, etc.
- By Status Board view so everyone can see where docs are in your process. Maybe something's been stuck in backlog forever, or you need one more round of feedback.
- By Creator See all the docs created by individuals across your team. Let's say you're coming up on annual reviews, you can get an instant sense of people's contributions.
- Only my Docs Create a new list view and filter it by the Creator property. Choose yourself to see only the docs that you created in one convenient spot.
- Only Engineering If your Docs database is open to your entire cross-functional org, you can add a filtered view that only shows docs created by and for engineering.

##########################################

Customize your Docs views in ways that are helpful for completing a task and understanding information quickly.
### Templates that standardize quality
Just like database templates can help you cover your bases during different types of meetings, they can enforce quality and comprehensiveness of thought in your Docs.
For instance, as you spec out a new product featureit's tempting to jot down rough ideas and start building. The right template can force you to pause, carefully articulate the problem you're trying to solve, identify the metrics you want to move, support your hypotheses, and work through edge cases.
This is how you get to consistent quality of execution across a growing technical organization.

We designed database templates to make it fast and simple to create content over and over again. But the real value is actually shaping your process. As you scale your team, nothing can give you more leverage than making it second nature for everyone to make good decisions on their own.
## See Meeting Notes & Docs in action
Not specific to engineering, but this video can give you a basis to make your own systems.
Just 9 minutes of watching for a future of good note taking.
## Next steps
Now that you have these databases up and running. There are a few things you can do to make them more powerful.

##########################################

### Link to notes from your engineering homepage
One of the benefits of managing everything in Notion is that you can create homes for every team inside your organization. Engineering can have its own page organized exactly the way they want here's how to build that kind of wiki.
Put your engineering team's meeting notes and docs a click away from the rest of your work by nesting them inside the same page.
### Connect your meetings to tasks & projects
If you also have your engineering projects in Notion, you can create a relation between any one project and all the meeting notes about it, or all related docs.

##########################################

- In your meeting notes database, add a new property, chooseRelationfrom the type menu and call itProject. Choose your projects database in the menu that pops up.
- For every set of notes, click on that property field to add the project you discussed.
Now, when you open a project page, you'll see all the meeting notes neatly organized and accessible. It's a two-way, automatic sync.

##########################################

### Get your whole team in the habit
Bringing any new system onto your team takes time. But once routines are built, they'll have an outsized impact on how you all think and work together. Here are some ideas to ease the way:
- Hover over the top of your database and clickAdd Description. Create quick instructions for using any system for all to see.
- Create database views relevant to your teammates in advance of sharing with them so they can see the value for their own work.For example, you might create views for mobile or infrastructure sub-teams to see only notes from their meetings.
* For example, you might create views for mobile or infrastructure sub-teams to see only notes from their meetings.
- Demo the convenience of database templates. Whenever you start a new meeting, share your screen with the group, apply an instant template, and take notes in real time.

# The ultimate guide to AI-powered knowledge hubs in Notion
Employees often struggle to find the information they need, leading to inefficiencies in your work and theirs  and costing your business in big ways.
We dreamed up with our customers of a better way to create and find your knowledge, and it's called an AI knowledge hub. These hubs can help you empower employees to find and understand information they need to do their jobs.
Whether youre onboarding new employees, creating single source of truth for your engineering documentation, supporting a customer experience team at scale, or looking for a low-lift way to deflect internal IT tickets, a knowledge hub with AI Q&A will help you do it.

##########################################

In this guide, well cover everything you need to know to build, roll out, and maintain your knowledge hub.
## Set your hub strategy and get stakeholder alignment
While you might be eager to dive into your knowledge hub build-out (as are we), its important to start with a plan. A successful AI implementation includes a clear strategic goal, identifyingwhowill use your knowledge hub,whatinformation they will find, andwhyyoure investing in building one at all.

##########################################

Consider the following tasks before you embark on building your knowledge hub in Notion:
- Identify who will use your hub Determine the primary users of your knowledge hub. This could include employees, departments, or specific teams that will rely on the hub for information.
- Determine key stakeholders Identify the people who will have a significant influence on the development and success of your knowledge hub. This is likely a group of folks including a Notion champion, a knowledge manager, an IT admin, and other folks that make sense within the context of your org (like bizops, or a chief of staff where relevant).
- Assess current state and gather user feedback Collect input from potential users to understand their needs and expectations for the knowledge hub. Learn where your audience is finding (or not finding) answers to their questions, and determine how long its currently taking them to do so. Your goal throughout this project will be to reduce that time spent searching.
- Find your documentation and create a content map for future state Next, dive into your docs. What questions can be answered with current documentation? Do you need to write new docs? Update old ones? Write this all down, youll come back to it later on.
- Set a measurable ROI goal At this point, we hope you have a sense of the pain points in your current workflows. That means its time to set a tangible goal for your upcoming project! Notion AI can help teams save significant time from searching for information and increase their overall productivity and satisfaction at work. Use theNotion AI ROIcalculator to set a goal for your team.

##########################################

The rest of this guide will walk you through the steps your team needs to take to transition from your current state to your new knowledge hub in Notion. Happy building!

## Create a space for your hub
Your team does its best work when everyone on it has access to the information they need to do their jobs, when they need it. Just like the entrance to your physical office sets the stage for a productive working day, your knowledge hub home-base sets (appropriately) high expectations for what your users will find in Notion.

##########################################

### Start with a teamspace, fill it with templates
Begin by setting up a dedicatedteamspacefor your knowledge hub. This space will serve as the central location where all knowledge hub templates and resources are stored. Make sure it is easily accessible to all team members who will be contributing to or using the hub, either by making it a default teamspace (so members are added automatically), or by setting the permissions to open such that anyone can join.
Once your teamspace is setup, you can begin building the architecture for your hub. For now, focus just on how users will navigate the hub. At a minimum, your knowledge hub template will include the following components.
Skip this step with templates for every team

##########################################

We created best-in-class templates for your knowledge:
- Engineering hub
- Onboarding hub
- Customer support hub
- IT trouble shooting hub, or
- Legal and compliance hub
To use these templates, duplicate them into your workspace, and move each page into the sidebar of your newly created teamspace. Then, read on for guidance on filling your hub with content and rolling it out to your team.

##########################################

- Top level page youll want to utilize a single, top-level page to act as a landing place for your knowledge hub. This is a place for your team to get a birds-eye-view of the information in your hub, and an understanding of how they can use it. Its also a great place tomentionpages that you want to draw attention to, or request feedback (more on that later).
- Wiki database (part of your top level page) once your top-level page is established, you can use the Turn to Wiki button in the...menu on the top left of your Notion page to create a new view for organizing sub-pages. Adding pages into a database will help immensely as you organize and scale your knowledge hub thanks to properties like tags and verification. Learn more about wiki databaseshere

##########################################

- FAQs the FAQ database serves two important purposes as you build out your knowledge hub. First, it creates a repository for key bits of information that are otherwise buried in long documents. Second, it helps AI more easily find the answers to commonly asked questions, ensuring your team gets what they need as quickly as possible.
- AI Q&A make sure you see the AI icon in the bottom right hand corner of your app (if not, check to make sure you have AI enabled in settings). This is where you and your end users will go to ask questions about the content in the knowledge hub.

##########################################

- Use-case specific trackers These are tailored to meet the specific needs of different teams within your organization  like a product feedback tracker, or IT request system. They help in gaining insight into workflows, tracking progress, and ensuring that everyone has access to the necessary information.

##########################################

### Selecting use-case specific trackers
Knowledge management in a modern workspace goes beyond just the documentation inside your wiki. Your employees need to find answers to more dynamic questions too  like the status of their IT ticket, whether someone else has recently left feedback on a specific product area, and so much more. A knowledge base that doubles as a tracker for your day-to-day work makes this dream a reality.
Consider the following examples. Each of these leverage Notions flexible structure to organize information in a way that is both accessible and actionable, enabling teams to collaborate more effectively.

## Fill your hub with content
Once youve set up the architecture of your knowledge hub, youre ready to start adding your teams content. This will likely be the longest step in your process, but will pay dividends when its time to roll your hub out to your end users. Remember that a knowledge hub is only as valuable as the quality of knowledge housed within it.

##########################################

### Move, import, and create your content
Remember how we told you to write down the docs you want to have in your knowledge hub? Time to grab that content map once again (or finish it if you havent yet). Once you have a high-level understanding of all the documents and FAQs that you want to add to your hub, youll start the heavy lifting. There are three main ways to bring content into your hub:
- Importcontent from other apps Bring in existing content from tools like Google Docs, Confluence, Asana, or even PDFs. Centralize your teams information and make it easily accessible within Notion by placing these pages into your Wiki.

##########################################

- UseMove toto gather content from your Notion workspace Consolidate all relevant Notion pages into your knowledge hub by using theMove tofunction and moving them into your new wiki database. This helps to keep your workspace organized and ensure that all necessary information is in one place.
- Create new content, and use AI to help AI can help you start from scratch to create a draft in seconds so all you have to do is add the extra information your team needs. Like uploaded files, video recordings, or even slide decks. Plus, If youre working through half-baked docs, or translating very technical language, try using Notion AI to expand and organize your thoughts into comprehensive, well-structured content.
Integrate with other tools

### Add AI connectors
AI connectors extend the reach of your self-serve knowledge hub, allowing your end-users to access the most up-to-date answers to their questions, even if they havent been documented (yet). Learn more about AI connectors here.

##########################################

### Polish and publish
Youre almost ready to share your knowledge hub with the world! Before you do, dot your metaphorical is and cross your metaphorical ts by making sure your information is well categorized and organized. Here are a few things we recommend:
- Clean up your page icons youd be surprised how far a couple of intentionally picked page icons can go when it comes to rolling out a nicely packaged knowledge hub. When in doubt, pick a color palette and give every page an icon of that color.
- Add a welcoming callout on your top-level page, add a quick callout explaining what users are looking at, and how theyll interact with it, and who to contact with questions. This helps to reduce the mental overhead required to engage with a new tool.

##########################################

- Tag pages in your wiki Use relevant tags to categorize your pages. This helps in searching and filtering information quickly.
## Share your hub with your team
Its the moment youve been waiting for! Rolling out your knowledge hub to your team is a huge accomplishment, but it isnt the end of the road. In order to ensure your end users get value out of your knowledge hub, youll need to invest time into training them on how to use it, and continuously reinforce its existence.

##########################################

### Configure permissions for your hub
Before you jump into training your team, make sure the right people have the right access to maintain and update your knowledge hub effectively. Youll manage permissions in the teamspace settings menu, and should deal with users in two primary groups:
- Add teamspace owners Teamspace owners act as the primary knowledge curators. They are responsible for the overall organization, structure, and maintenance of the knowledge hub.Youll want to give them Full Access so that they can create, edit, and delete all pages within the teamspace.As teamspace owners, theyll also be able to adjust teamspace settings, invite/remove members, and manage permissions.
- Then, add teamspace Members Teamspace members contribute to the knowledge base by adding new information, updating existing content, and actively engaging with the AI-powered features. They are also the primary consumers of the knowledge.Give them Can edit permissions to edit existing pages and create new pages within the teamspace.

##########################################

Teamspaces are Notions solution to complex permission requirements

### Announce your hub, train your team
Now that everyone has access to your knowledge hub, its time to announce your hub and train your team. Youll know what announcement channels tend to work best for your company (and we have some tips below, too!), but dont forget to teach your audience how to use your new tool.
To start, make sure your end users have the resources they need to navigate your knowledge hub. In your announcement comms, focus on helping users learn how tonavigate using the sidebar, and how toget answers about work content faster with Q&A.

##########################################

Start emphasizing the value of Notion AI, even demo-ing some questions that users can find the answers to within your new and improved knowledge hub.
Give your team the resources they need
Click to expand

##########################################

### Focus on internal communications
If a resource is created, and no one knows about it, does it even exist? Internal comms are a vital component of your rollout strategy, and you should expect to spend a few weeks (up to a few months) showing off your new hub. Heres just a few ideas that have helped our customers:
- Start with a pilot group for a bigger roll out, consider starting with a pilot. A diverse pilot group across departments can help test the knowledge hub and gather feedback on usability, content, and AI effectiveness before a larger launch.
- Preview your hub in a team meeting or all hands schedule a dedicated session to walk through the knowledge hub, highlight key features, and demonstrate how to use it effectively. This ensures everyone is familiar with the new resource.
- Send written communications about your hub draft an email or internal memo that outlines the purpose of the knowledge hub, provides usage instructions, and includes a link to access it. This helps to reinforce the hub's importance and utility.
- Stop answering questions this is the hardest, and most important component of a successful knowledge hub rollout. In order to build new habits, youll want to continuously re-direct your question-asking colleagues to your new and improved knowledge hub. Gently remind them to ask their question to Notion AI before asking in your slack channel or DMs.

##########################################

## Grow & maintain your hub
Think of your wiki as a garden. Just as a garden needs regular tending to flourish, your knowledge hub requires continuous updates and care. Plant new ideas, prune outdated information, and nurture the content to keep it vibrant and useful for everyone who visits.
### Keep your content fresh
One of the worst detractors to the long-term health of your knowledge hub is stale or outdated content. Thats why its important to set up systems to keep your content fresh.

##########################################

We recommend starting with the following:
- Add verified properties verified properties ensure that the information in your knowledge hub is accurate and trustworthy. Implement a process where subject matter experts review and approve content on a regular cadence. Theyll get notifications when their content is about to expire.
- Create an admin view an admin view allows administrators to oversee and manage the content more efficiently. This view can include filters and sorting options to quickly identify outdated or inaccurate information.

##########################################

- Keep content in a single database Centralizing your content in one database prevents information sprawl and makes it easier to maintain. This structure helps in keeping the knowledge hub organized and ensures that users can find information quickly. Learn more about how Notion AI finds answershere.
- Utilize AI autofill AI can summarize or extract information from all of your wiki entries at once based on a single prompt. This can help to save time by generating answers based on text in a page, without you having to read through each one manually.

##########################################

### Tips & tricks for growing your hub over time
- Add an upvote button Encourage users to interact with content by giving it an upvote. This helps prioritize valuable information. Learn more about database buttonshere.
- Create a feedback database Set up a database to collect and manage user feedback about the knowledge hub itself to assist with continuous improvement.
- Usepage analyticsthese can help you see which what content is getting the most use and prioritize updates accordingly.
- Schedule regular content reviews set up a recurring schedule to review and update the information in your knowledge hub. This ensures that the content remains relevant and accurate over time.

##########################################

Building and maintaining an AI-powered knowledge hub in Notion is an ongoing process that requires careful planning, organization, and continuous improvement. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can create a valuable resource that not only helps your team access the information they need but also leverages the power of AI to keep your documentation up-to-date and easily searchable. Remember, the key to a successful knowledge hub is engagement and feedback from your users, so make sure to encourage interaction and continuously refine your content based on their needs.

# Understanding Notions sharing settings
Sharing pages is table stakes for working with your team in Notion  it enables communication and cross-functional teamwork.
But there are different ways to share pages depending on what you or your team needs. You can share pages with individuals. You can share pages with teams or entire companies. You can even share pages with the external agencies that help you work. And understanding these nuances is foundational to collaboration.
Here, we'll explain the different ways to share Notion pages, so you can easily grant the right level of access to those who need it, from workspace members to guests.

##########################################

## Basics about who's in your workspace
There are four types of people that live inside a Notion workspace:
- Workspace owners  these are usually the people who oversee the workspace, like adding members,creating permission groups, and configuring the advanced security settings.
- Membership admins (Enterprise plans only)  these are leaders who can add members and edit permission groups, but cant change workspace settings.
- Members  the rest of your team will be members of the workspace. They can create Notion pages, share and edit them, but they cant change the workspace settings or add new members (here's more info onmembers).
- Guests  these will likely be people outside your organization that you want to collaborate with, such as clients or third-party vendors. You can invite them to view and edit pages, but they wont have access to the whole workspace.

##########################################

TheSettings & membersmenu in the sidebar is where youll go to manage permissions.
Here, under theMemberstab, workspace owners can add new members to the workspace by clickingAdd members, then either searching for their name, entering their email address, or copying and sending them the Invite link. When youve added someone, you can use the toggle next to their name to decide which membership type to give them.
If you'd like to learn more aboutmembership types, we got you covered.
One of the easiest ways to start working with your team in Notion is to enable those with a work email to join your workspace automatically.

##########################################

InSettings & members, go toSettingsand scroll down to theAllowed email domainssection. Here, you can type one or more email domains (@yourcompany.com, for example) that you want to grant access to automatically.
Whenever someone signs into Notion with an email with one of those domains, theyll have the option to join your workspace. If you go to theDomainsection, you can create a custom URL for the workspace. You can share this with anyone who has an allowed email domain, and theyll be able to join the workspace immediately.

##########################################

## Different ways to share a Notion page
Sharing pages can be situational. You might want to quickly send a product spec to a designer for review. Or you could ask for company-wide feedback on a new process doc. You may even need to put a link into a Notion page in an email.
Whatever the case, knowing how to share these pages will help ensure the right people see the right page. Open the Share menu to view (and edit!) who has access to the page, and what level of access they have.
### Sharing with workspace members
There are different ways to share content with workspace members.

##########################################

- Share with your whole company youll want to share some pages with everyone at your company, even if they can only view or comment. You can do this from your sidebar by dragging the page into the General teamspace, which includes everyone at your company.
- Share with a member of your workspaceselect or type their name into the Add people, groups, or emails box and click Invite to share the page with a member of your workspace. This is great for quick collaboration, or for 1:1s between manager and direct report.

##########################################

- Share pages with your team Teamspaces make it easy to create a shared space with your team, where youll keep all content relevant to your work. Each department in your organization can have its own teamspace, and youll also have a General teamspace for company-wide information.

## Sharing with people outside your organization
- Share the page with a guest in theAdd peoplebox, type the email address of the person youd like to share the page with. These are likely the external partners you're working with, where all you need is their input on a single page (or small collection of pages).

##########################################

- Publish the page to the web if you want anyone to be able to view the page, you can publish it to the web by navigating to the Publish tab and clickingPublish to web. You can make the page visible to search engines by turning onSearch engine indexing. This is beneficial if you want to use Notion to extend your website, like publishing a help center or FAQs for customers to access. Heresa walkthroughof publishing pages to the web.
- Send via a linkyou can quickly share a page internally or externally by copying and sending the page link. You can easily drop the link into a Slack conversation or email.

##########################################

## Setting page permissions
As well as sharing pages, you can change permissions for people or groups, whether they are members or guests of the workspace. This ensures that, when sharing pages, those with access to pages have the right level of access.
In the sharing menu, click the dropdown next to a name or a group. Youll see that you can choose between 4 options Full access, which allows full editing rights plus the ability to share the page,Can edit,Can comment, orCan view.
You can clickRemoveto remove someones access to the page, and it will no longer be visible to them.

##########################################

When you publish a page to the web, you can click theShow link optionsdropdown and set whether people can comment, view or edit the page. Like the example we shared above, you probably wouldn't want anyone on the web editing your company's FAQ page.
If youre an workspace owner of anEnterpriseaccount, you can restrict how content is shared. InSettings & Members, in the Security tab, youll find some options that you can toggle on and off which allow you to prevent members from sharing pages publicly, adding guests, moving pages to other workspaces, or exporting content.
Keep this in mind when sharing pages with sub-pages

## How teams can use sharing settings for collaboration
We've seen companies share information different ways, depending on who needs to see or edit that information. Here are some common examples of ways your team can use Notion's sharing settings for better collaboration:
- Your benefits information or mission statement for documents that everyone in your company needs to see, you can useShare with everyone at [your company]. You can give certain team members, such as HR managersFull access, and make the pageCan viewfor everyone else.

##########################################

- A design draft or project spec when you need the whole design or engineering team to view or collaborate on something, you can use permission groups to share with everyone at once. This is useful when two teams, like engineering and product, need to work together. Set up permission groups for each team, then you can share the page with the whole team at once.
- A document that youre working on with one or two others when you need to share something with just one other person, such as a 1:1 database between a manager and team member, you can share the pages with that person individually. You can create the database in the private section of yoursidebar, so no one else has access to it. Then, share it with individuals by typing their names intoAdd people.

##########################################

- Requesting feedback from a client agencies who work with external clients might need to share mock-ups or proposals and ask clients for feedback on those pages. Invite them to the page as a guest by typing in their email address, and grant them permission to comment.
- Your companys FAQs or help center anything you want to share with the world, such as your FAQs or help center, can be published to the web. Toggle onShare to the weband toggle different options depending on whether you want people to be able to edit, comment, or duplicate the page.

# Unearth fresh insights from your personal knowledge library using Q&A
Notion is your personal knowledge bank, where you keep notes, documents, ideas, and scraps of inspiration. As your library of knowledge grows, you need a way to surface information so you can extract value from it.
After all, taking notes is great, but without an easy way to reference key knowledge and build on the ideas, you might end up with a vast library of idle information.
With Notion Q&A, you can ask questions about anything in your workspace, and get a succinct answer that summarizes all relevant content across the workspace, and makes sense of the knowledge youve gathered.

##########################################

In this guide, well demonstrate how to use Notion Q&A to unearth insights, discover patterns in your web of knowledge, and synthesize multiple resources into new takeaways.
## Q&A adds another layer to your Notion productivity system
A productivity system for business, studies, or personal growth must allow you to do several things - capture ideas and resources, keep them organized and easy to find, and extract value from your information.

##########################################

In Notion, you capture information using a notes database or web clipper. Then, database properties, sorts, and filters allow you to organize content. With these tools you can quickly build a large repertoire of knowledge, and Q&A is the final piece of the puzzle that allows you to unearth helpful information when you need it.
While many productivity systems encourage you to continuously prune your archives to remove irrelevant content, with Q&A you dont need to do this. Instead, keep everything, and use Q&A to filter through your best ideas and build new connections.

##########################################

Instead of relying on your brain to remember what youve read and archived, you can ask Q&A any question about the content in your workspace. Then, it will find the relevant pages, summarize their contents and provide a pithy answer to your query.
## How to synthesize your knowledge with Notion Q&A
Anytime you have a question about the information in your workspace, just click the purple sparkle in the bottom right of your screen to bring up Q&A.
Type out your question, and Q&A will provide an answer based on the content in your workspace.

##########################################

You can ask Q&A to:
- Explain the difference between a plant an animal cell Q&A will review all resources youve saved on this topic and summarize the difference.
- Find evidence that screen time can reduce a childs attention span Q&A will collect sources youve saved that support your argument.
- Show me information about a client If you want to review docs related to a new client youve just onboarded, Q&A can surface the relevant material.

# Unleashing collaboration with Notion's Jira integration
In today's fast-paced world, teams often juggle multiple tools, leading to scattered information and clunky workflows. While engineering teams are deep in Jira territory, other departments might struggle to access or understand that valuable data.

##########################################

Imagine a world where your project management tools work in perfect harmony. Integrating Jira with Notion bridges the gap between technical and non-technical teams, creating a unified workflow. By syncing Jira projects and issues into Notion's flexible workspace, you establish a single source of truth, ensuring everyone stays informed. While Jira remains the powerhouse for detailed project tracking, Notion provides a clear and accessible overview for those who aren't Jira experts.

##########################################

In this guide, you'll learn how to:
- Understand the ropesconnect with Jira and understand the roles of workspace members vs. workspace owners
- Explore three ways to maximize your integration beyond basic database syncing
- Make Jira data accessible and easy to understand for everyone in your team, even if they don't use Jira directly
## Get your Jira sync up and running
The Jira Sync integration connects Jira projects with Notion through the use of an Admin API token (instead of a user token), allowing for a more unified experience. First things firstyou'll need a workspace owner to connect Notion with Jira (check out how to do thathere).

##########################################

Once everything's up and running, any workspace member can create new syncs, add projects, or customize things to their likingas long as they have the right permissions.

### Best practices for connecting Jira and Notion
Now that you're all set up, let's dive into some best practices that'll help you hit the ground running:
- Set up permissions for Jira sync While we check your Jira access during sync, you'll still need to manage who sees what in Notion. Make sure your Jira admin account has access to these projects too. Remember that only folks with access to a project can add it to Notion, even if an admin has access.

##########################################

- Authenticate your account when adding or editing projects Anyone in your workspace can set up a new sync in a teamspace they can access. However, you may need to connect your Jira account first for authentication. You'll also need edit access to make changes to existing syncs. While admin authentication handles the heavy lifting of syncing everything, your personal authentication lets us know who you are and what private projects you can bring over to Notion.

##########################################

- Make it your own with custom views Once your Jira data is in Notion, anyone with access can create views that work best for them. Your product manager might love a Kanban board showing issues by status, while your QA team might prefer a table view focused on open bugs. The original data stays the same  you're just looking at it in different ways!
- When to use "linked views" vs. "new syncs" If your teamspace already has a Jira sync, create a linked view instead of a new sync to avoid the proliferation of duplicate data. For example, if Engineering has a Jira sync for bugs and Design needs to track them too, create a linked view of the existing sync. This keeps everything in sync and makes updates smoother.

## Three ways to maximize your integration beyond basic database syncing
The real magic of syncing Jira happens when you create a unified information hub that supercharges your team's workflow. By combining Jira's robust project tracking with Notion's flexible workspace, you break down silos and give everyone access to real-time updates.

##########################################

### Let's dive into three ways that show you how to maximize its potential beyond basic database syncing:
1. Consolidate and sync Jira issues with your My Tasks database
Jira issues assigned to you now appear alongside your Notion tasks in theMy Tasksdatabase on your Notion homepage. This integration provides a unified view of all your tasks, regardless of their origin. Imagine you're an engineer launching a new feature. Now you can see all your to-dos in one place, no matter where they came from. Jira issues are easy to spot, denoted by a Jira icon next to the task, allowing you to quickly differentiate them from other tasks in yourMy Tasksdatabase.

##########################################

### 2. Run smoother and more collaborative engineering stand-ups
Jira is great for tracking project progress, especially during sprints. But for daily stand-ups and check-ins, it can feel a bit too structured. Imagine this  you're an engineering manager leading a team building a new mobile app. You're using Jira to keep track of your team's key tasks. Still, you're finding it tricky to capture all those important discussion points in Jira. Plus, you really want to bring more of those big-picture, qualitative ideas into your workflow.

##########################################

Here's how to set up an efficient stand-up process using Notion and Jira:
- Create a central stand-up corner in Notion Start by making a page just for your stand-up meeting notes. You can usebuttonsorrecurring database templatesto quickly create your meeting notes. Divide your page into these three sections:Sprint tasks A space to sync your Jira sprints databaseDiscussion topics A space to chat about roadblocks, ideas, pivots, and improvementsAction items A space to capture action items on the go
* Sprint tasks A space to sync your Jira sprints database
* Discussion topics A space to chat about roadblocks, ideas, pivots, and improvements
* Action items A space to capture action items on the go

##########################################

- Integrate Jira sprints into your stand-up space Under "Sprint tasks," add alinked viewof your Jira sprint. This linked view offers real-time updates without duplicating data, keeping your workspace clutter-free. To add a linked view of your database, type forward slash/linked view of databaseand select the database of your choice. You can fine-tune access permissions for both Jira databases and Notion docs, ensuring only the right people see your Jira data in Notion.

##########################################

- Capture insights and action items Use the "Discussion topics" section to jot down brilliant ideas, key decisions, and crucial action items that pop up during the stand-up. This space is perfect for collaborative problem-solving, sharing quick team updates, and highlighting important announcements.
After the meeting, you can easily reference all your action items and takeaways in one place, making it simpler to add them into Jira. This way, nothing falls through the cracks, and you keep everything flowing smoothly between both platforms. By blending Jira's powerful structured task tracking with Notion's flexible note taking, you're creating a central resource that keeps everyone in sync throughout your project's journey.

##########################################

### 3. Connect and centralize project resources in one unified space
A great project is more than just a to-do list or a sprint board. It's a mix of PRDs, tech specs, meeting notes, and even go-to-market plans. Combining Jira with Notion creates a complete hub for your projects. This setup brings together all important project parts in one place.

##########################################

Let's say you're leading a project to set up two-factor authentication. Various elements play a crucial role in bringing this project to life. Here's how you can centralize all your resources:
- Create spaces for all your documents Create dedicated spaces in your Project hub to organize different document types. Set up areas for Tech Specs (PRDs), Design (mockups), and Meeting Notes (team discussions). This organized layout makes it easy for everyone to find what they need and add their own work. Try out differentpage layoutsto find one that works best for your team.

##########################################

- Bring in Jira projects and issues After setting up your project space for the 2FA project, you can customize the Jira data display to match your team's needs. Show or hide properties that matter most to your team. For example, display active Jira issues with key details like work status and priority level. This gives your team a clear view of ongoing work without leaving Notion.
- Connect your Jira tasks with other Notion pages Tasks rarely exist in isolation. For example, the 2FA project might be part of a larger marketing campaign focused on online safety. You can easily visualize these connections in Notion by using relations to link your Jira tasks with related project pages. You can learn more about relationshere.

##########################################

By bringing all these elements together, you're breaking down information silos and giving everyone a clear view of the project's progress.
## How to get the most out of Jira insights in Notion
While Jira is great for engineering teams, it might not be as helpful for non-technical folks. These teams often want to pull out key project info from complex Jira setups and bring it into Notion's flexible workspace. There, they can connect it with things like meeting notes, project docs, or even create automations to kickstart their own work streams.

##########################################

Here are three ways you can use Jira to extract the most important information without diving into the nitty-gritty of a technical Jira setup:
- Send Slack updates to team channels When a task in the "Website Redesign" project is marked as "Done" in Jira and synced to Notion, it can trigger a friendly Slack message to the #marketing channel.
- Create new pages when something is added to Jira For instance, when a new epic titled "Mobile App Overhaul" is created in Jira, a Product Requirements Document (PRD) template in Notion can be populated with the epic's details, creating a collaborative space for further planning and discussion.

##########################################

- Create rollups to see the completion rate of your projects For example, create a rollup in Notion that shows the percentage of completed tasks for each sprint in your "Q4 Product Launch" project. This gives stakeholders a quick, clear view of project progress without needing to dive into Jira's technical details. You can learn more about roll upshere.
These automations handle routine tasks automatically, helping your team work more efficiently and collaboratively.

##########################################

Jira sync brings teams together by connecting detailed project tracking in Jira with Notion's collaborative workspace. While Jira handles the technical nitty-gritty, Notion makes everything easy to find and use. The best part? Team members who don't need Jira's complex features can still stay connected through Notion. By bringing everything together in Notion, you'll break down information silos, boost cross-team collaboration, and save costs all while keeping your work organized and in sync.

##########################################

# Unleashing productivity with Notion's Slack integration
Teams rely on both Notion and Slack to get work done, but information often gets lost in the shuffle. Slack conversations can be hard to track, to-dos might be missed, and the important knowledge in Notion can feel disconnected. Jumping back and forth between tools can lead to distractions and make it difficult to focus on what's important.
Integrating Slack with Notion cuts out the constant back-and-forth between apps, allowing you to stay laser-focused. The result? Your productivity skyrockets.

##########################################

## Set up notifications between Slack and Notion databases
When you integrate Slack with Notion, you can set up two types of notifications:
- Privately, to yourself Set up alerts to notify you whenever you're mentioned anywhere in Notion.
- To a public Slack channel Usedatabase automationsto send alerts to specific Slack channels whenever there are updates to a Notion database.
These automatic alerts help you stay on top of your projects. They make sure you don't miss any important updates or requests.

##########################################

### Get private Slack notifications when you're mentioned in Notion
A teammate might tag you in different parts of a page, like in the content, a comment, or the person property in a database. This tagging usually occurs when you're given a task or project. You can customize notifications to alert you whenever you get tagged. A slack message will show informing you of the context in which you were mentioned.
Here's how to set it up:
- In Notion's side panel, navigate toSettings & Members, then selectMy Notifications & Settings.
- Select the Slack workspace name in the text and drop-down menu.
You can turn these notifications on or off at any time using the drop-down menu.
Reply to Notion Comments from Slack

##########################################

Pro Tip: You can also respond to Notion comments directly from Slack. Just click reply, type your response, and send. Your reply will appear as a normal comment in Notion.
### Send Slack notifications to a channel whenyour Notion database is updated
Keeping track of changes in a Notion database can be difficult, especially with frequent updates. For example, you might want to know when the status of a task in your project database gets updated. Slack notifications can provide timely alerts to a specific channel whenever important updates occur in your Notion project database.

##########################################

Imagine you want a notification whenever a task is marked 'complete' in your projectdatabase.Toset this up:
- Open your database and click theat the top of a database Automations. Alternatively, you can selectat the top of a database.
- ClickAdd trigger. A drop-down menu will appear with options. Choose your desired propertyin this case, you might want to selectStatusfrom the property list.
- For properties with multiple options (like the one you picked), choose which changes you want to be notified about. In this case, select only 'complete' and uncheck all other choices. Then clickDone.
- Under the 'Do this' section, clickAdd action, chooseSlack notifications, and give your notification a name.
- Select the Slack channel where you want to send your notifications.
- When you're satisfied with your settings, clickcreate.

##########################################

Voil! From now on, whenever a task is marked as complete, Notion will automatically send a notification to your chosen Slack channel. With a myriad of customization options, you can fine-tune Notion's Slack notifications to fit your needs.
Add Multiple Triggers to Your Database Automation
Pro Tip: You can add as many triggers as you want to your notification. To add a new trigger, click on the plus sign and pick whatever extra change you want to keep track of.

##########################################

## Capture tasks, feedback, or bugs that come up in Slack in just a few clicks
Often, important tasks, decisions, or bugs come up during a chat with teammates on Slack. Instead of stepping away from your conversation to log them in a database, you can save these items in Notion directly through Slack. You can also add details like priority or assignee at the same time.
For instance, employees might send product feedback to your Engineering Slack channel. The Product team can then collect these issues and add them directly to their database for tracking bugs.
To get started, follow these steps:
- ClickMore Actionson the Slack message you want to save to a database and selectCreate task in Notion.

##########################################

2. Select your database by entering its name, pasting the Notion database link, or choosing it from your frequently used databases list.
3. Provide a title for your database entry.
4. ClickAdd Propertyto set any relevant properties for your entry.
5. Once done, clickSave. Slack will inform you in the channel that the new database item has been created.
Your new task is now visible in your Notion database. To view your new database page, click on the entry's name.
## Provide richer context to conversations using link previews
No matter where you're working, it helps to have as much context as possible. Link previews across both Notion and Slack make the sharing experience seamless.

##########################################

### Link previews in Slack
When you share a Notion page link in Slack, it will automatically unfurl to show the page's title and creator. This preview helps everyone quickly understand the content of the page, even if they don't have access. This nice sneak peek means your colleagues won't need to wonder about the context behind a link. They'll get a preview of the page and be able to see how relevant it is to them at a glance.
Quick Access Sharing from Slack

##########################################

Pro Tip: When you share a Notion page link in Slack, some people might not have access. A pop-up will appear, asking if you want to give them access. You can do this right from Slack, so you don't have to go back to Notion to change sharing settings. This also makes sure your teammates don't have to ask for access separately.
Every Notion page shows a link preview back to the Slack thread, so you can always see the original message for context. This smooth integration helps you understand Notion documents right from Slack, getting rid of the need for manual summaries.

##########################################

### Link previews in Notion
Important insights often emerge unexpectedly in Slack conversations. You can easily preserve that knowledge by pasting those messages into Notion. The messages will appear as a link preview, allowing you to easily embed them into project briefs, user research documents, or your company wiki.
This makes it easier to find information without searching through Slack. It also helps readers quickly access the original message. This way, they can easily contact the person who first shared the information if they need to.

##########################################

To copy a Slack message :
- Click the three-dot menu on the relevant message, namedMore Actions.
- SelectCopy Linkfrom the drop-down menu.
- Navigate to the desired location in Notion and paste the link as a mention, preview or link.

# Use AI connectors to access more of your teams knowledge
In an ideal world, your team's knowledge would be neatly organized in one place, regularly updated, and consistently shared across teams. However, for most organizations, this "work about work" often falls to the bottom of the priority list.
Teams are whisked away by a need to respond here, attend a meeting there, and by the end of the day, theyre drained, and vital knowledge remains scattered and disorganized across tools. While AI chatbots offer promises to speed up our work, they both lack crucial company context and exist in a separate digital space, limiting their usefulness.

##########################################

Notion is the first tool to combine your companys knowledge  across multiple tools  right alongside the rest of your work.
## Search across tools with AI connectors
When you integrate Slack or Google Drive with Notion AI, you can ask questions and receive relevant information from these connected sources. Notion AI will provide answers and cite the specific references it used, allowing you to access knowledge across multiple platforms seamlessly.
Notion AI can keep up with Slack discussions, remember every Google Slides presentation, and be accessed with the press of a button  inside Notion, or globally with the shortcutShift + Cmd + J.

## Transforming your organization with AI connectors
AI connectors are powerful tools that bridge the gap between Notion and your other workplace applications. These connectors allow Notion's AI to access and utilize information from various sources, creating a more comprehensive and efficient workflow. Here's a deeper look at how AI connectors enhance teams day to day:
- Reduce time spent searchingOn average, workers spend 3 hours a day* searching for information (*Check out theNotion AI ROI templateto learn more) . This wasted time can hinder productivity and innovation. AI connectors transform Notion into a centralized information hub,saving up to 10 minutes per question asked, enabling teams to make faster, more informed decisions.
- Tap in to otherwise unused knowledgeToo often, valuable ideas are buried deep in Slack threads, intended to be shared later but ultimately forgotten to time. Notion AI has the capability to recall that knowledge right when you need it, maximizing the creative impact of your teams innovation. It can also cite useful information you didn't even know you had (like a new update from your company's all-hands presentation that pairs well with the report you're working on).
- Maintain focus and productivity Context switching between apps can disrupt your workflow and burden you with distracting messages and notifications. With AI seamlessly integrated into Notion, you can access the information you need without breaking your concentration, allowing you to stay in a productive flow state as long as you need.
- Consolidate your tool stackJust like other work software, most AI tools are made up of a set of fundamental actions (weve been saying this for years). Notion AI is designed with these building blocks in mind. That means it doesntjustallow you to search other tools; but its also your teams chatbot, writing partner, and so much more  so you dont have to juggle dozens of apps to get work done.

- Check our ourguide for getting started with Notion AI

## Getting started with connected tools
### Getting started with AI Connector for Slack
We sometimes say Slack is like the other half of Notion. If all of your permanent docs live inside Notion, then all of your ephemeral conversations happen in Slack. By connecting Slack to Notion, you can bridge the gap between these two crucial communication channels. This integration allows you to seamlessly search and reference Slack conversations directly within Notion, ensuring that no important information slips through the cracks.

##########################################

Heres just a few ways we see the Slack connector show up in teams workflows:
- Write smarter status reportsProject managers responsible for writing a daily or weekly status report will appreciate the ability to ask Notion AI to note everything thats happened in a certain time period.
- Summarize rambling threadsExtracting insights from threads in Slack can be tedious, but with Notion AI connected to Slack, you can simply ask to gather all ideas related to a certain project and insert them into the document.
- Keep track of critical announcementsTry using Notion AI to gather context before diving into a brand new doc. You might be surprised what you find, and how it stops you from going down the wrong path.

### Getting started with AI Connector for Google Docs, Sheets and Slides
Google Drive is a vital hub for many teams, housing essential documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. By connecting it to Notion, you're bringing this wealth of information directly into your workflow.
With the Google Drive connector, Notion AI can quickly reference key data from Google Documents, Slides or Sheets without switching apps or even compile research from various Google Docs into your Notion projects.

##########################################

Heres just a few ways we see the Google Drive connector show up in teams workflows:
- Bring formal messaging into your docsYour teams may work in Notion, but you likely have a slide library elsewhere with your formal pitches, all-hands presentations, and more. This form of information sharing can be really helpful to individuals trying to succinctly capture and share context ahead of a project.
- Access legacy knowledgeIf youve largely switched off of google docs but havent imported everything over to Notion, an AI connector can help bridge the gap. This way, you have access to the information you need, but only when you need it.
- Improve sharing across teamsSome teams' work requires them to stay in other tools. For instance, your legal team might work primarily in Google Docs for contract drafting. The Google Drive connector allows other teams to easily reference key terms in Notion without disrupting the legal team's workflow, ensuring everyone has access to the latest information.

# Use Asana link previews to keep your teams on the same page
Your team just started using Notion to manage marketing projects, but what about the email campaign thats mid-way through, or the help center revamp project youre about to wrap up? Maybe youve been tracking all that work on another tool like Asana. Or maybe a department you collaborate with, like design, have just renewed their Asana subscription and arent ready to migrate to Notion just yet.

##########################################

Luckily, you can use start using Notion today in combination with other tools to organize, manage and track all your work. Link previews allow you to paste content from other tools into your Notion pages, so everyone with access to the page can view the content even if they dont have a subscription to that tool.
This means you can include everything your marketing team needs in a project page, from Asana tasks, to Dropbox files, and even your Miro boards. This makes collaboration a breeze and keeps everyone on track, regardless of what tools they use.
Well show you how link previews can help consolidate everyones work into a single source of truth for project and knowledge management.

##########################################

## How to create Asana link previews
You can create a link preview of an Asana task or project on any Notion page.
To do this, go to the task or project in Asana, and click on theCopy linkicon. Paste the link into Notion, and selectPaste as preview.
Youll then be prompted to connect to Asana, if you havent already. ClickConnect to Asana to updateand follow the link to grant permission.
Now, your task will appear as a link preview, and youll be able to see key information such as due date, assignee, and last updated time.
You can follow the same process for creating link previews of content from other tools.

##########################################

## Link previews bring all relevant in formation into your project page
You can use a page in your projects database to compile all relevant information about your project.
A project page might include:
- An outline of the project scope and briefWrite out your goals for the project, reasoning, and how you aim to get the work done
- Filtered view of tasks databaseYou can create a linked view of your Tasks database and filter it to show tasks related to the project.
- Links to relevant resources and files You can paste links to useful resources, research and reference information
- Previews of Asana tasks, Dropbox files and more Using link previews, paste in tasks to do or project pages from Asana, or files from Dropbox for everyone to see.

##########################################

Projects & task management in Notion
Our Projects & tasks templates are purpose-built for project management and include custom properties and relations. Discover how to use themhere.
## Create synced databases to view Asana tasks in different ways
If your cross-functional collaborators keep all project tracking information in Asana, your team risks being out of the loop. But, instead of logging in to yet another tool to see whats going on, you can import all the information in Asana straight into a Notion database using a synced database.
Whats helpful about synced databases is that you can import the Asana content, including properties like title, assignee, completed and created date, description and more.

##########################################

The content will update automatically, but can only be edited from within Asana, preventing any accidental changes to the information.
Though you cant edit the database content, you can adjust the layout, and add filters and sorts to create different contextual views.
To create a synced Asana database, type the/command and selectAsana synced database. Then choose the Asana database you want to sync, and select whether you want to share synced content with Anyone on the page, or keep it private.
## Connect additional tools usinglink previews and synced databases
You can use link previews and synced databases across your workspace in many different ways.

##########################################

For example:
- Sync your content calendar across tools If your content team plan and create content in Asana, the content calendar doesnt have to stay hidden. Create a synced database in Notion, change the layout to board view, and everyone will be able to see what content is coming up next.
- Provide all the necessary context to your product launch document Lots of pieces have to come together for a successful product launch. If information is contained in different tools, you can bring it all together in one Notion page using link previews and synced databases.
- Manage your social media calendar Just like the content calendar, you can manage the big picture collaboration in Notion even if the social media team are happily working in Asana for more detailed tasks and reviews of copy.

# Use Notion AI to give teams perfect memory, and save time
Traditional knowledge management tools can be difficult to use, and even harder to configure. As a knowledge manager, you spend hours crafting the perfect setup to enable your team to self-serve the information they need. So why does it feel like they can never find what you write?
With Notion, you can easily create a knowledge base for your internal teams. But whats more, when team members need to get a question answered, all they have to do is ask Notion AI.

##########################################

Notions Q&A function, powered by AI, searches through all of your relevant knowledge base articles to put together a concise answer. It even cites its sources. And unlike a generic chatbot, if it cant find an answer, it wont make one up.
In this guide, youll learn:
- How teams can use Q&A to self-serve information
- How to create a wiki to manage your knowledge base
- How to set up permissions and onboard team members into your Notion knowledge base
## Understand how your teams can use Notion AI to self-serve information they need
When all of your information lives inside Notion, all your teammates need to do is ask a question, using normal language, and Notion AI will provide a response  citing any pages where that information lives.

##########################################

How does Notion AI work?
Click to expand
Here are a few practical ways your teams can use this feature:
- Software troubleshooting or help desk for IT teams If a team member is addressing a software issue, they could use Notion AI to ask, "What are the common troubleshooting steps for our CRM software?" Provided this knowledge exists in your wiki, Notion AI would then provide a list of potential solutions, helping the team member to resolve the issue without having to create an IT help desk ticket.

##########################################

- Customer Support for CX agents A CX agent could use Notion AI to ask, "What is our refund policy for subscription services?" Notion AI would then provide the specific information from your knowledge base, helping the CX agent to respond to customer inquiries accurately and efficiently.
- Onboarding procedures for HR & managers A new hire could ask, "What are the onboarding procedures for the marketing department?" Notion AI would then provide a concise overview of the relevant procedures, helping the new team member to get up to speed quickly.
- Company policies for people teams To understand "What is the company's remote work policy?", a team member could pose this question to Notion AI and get the information they need without having to search through the company handbook or ask in Slack.

##########################################

- Live objection handling for GTM teams When your sellers and support agents are on calls with customers they need to instant access to the knowledge in your battle cards, competitive analysis, roadmap, and more. With Notion AI, all they need to do is ask a question, and theyll get an instant response.
Asking questions in natural language can save as much as5 minutesof searching time per query, massively improving efficiency for your organization as it scales. So how do you get started?

##########################################

## Create a wiki to house your teams knowledge
The first step to using Notion as a home-base for your support team is centralizing all of your existing docs into Notion. We recommend using the wiki feature to do so, since it comes with extra properties for managing knowledge  like verification.
Import your content to skip this step
Click to expand

##########################################

Every page in your wiki can be assigned an owner, and verification status, along with any other tags that are useful to your organization. To build a wiki, follow the steps below:
- Prepare your content Start by creating or identifying the pages that you want to include in your knowledge base. These could be existing pages in Notion that contain information on your team's processes, policies, or any other relevant content, or content that youre moving from another tool.
- Build your top-level page Assemble all of the content youve identified into one page, with sub-pages. If youre new to Notion, learn about creating pages and subpageshere.
- Turn your page into a Wiki Once you have your content ready, you can convert it into a wiki to unlock additional properties that will help manage your knowledge. To do this, navigate to the top-level page of your content, click on the three dots in the top right corner to open the page options menu, and select "Turn to wiki".
- Update and maintain your Wiki Remember that a knowledge base is a living resource. In your newly formed wiki you can assign owners to each article and set expiration dates on content. Learn more about building a wiki in Notionhere.

##########################################

## Configure permissions before adding your team
Once youre ready to start inviting team members into Notion, youll want to learn about permissions.
As a knowledge manager youre likely thoughtful about who can edit your content, and it's important to strike a balance between protecting the integrity of your information and allowing for collaborative knowledge creation. To this end, teamspaces allow you to configure nuanced permission levels that suit your needs.
In your teamspace settings, you can set the default permission level to can view for most members. Then, you can individually grant higher levels of access to content managers who need it.

##########################################

This way, as you start to add members, theyll have access to everything they need, but wont be able to make any accidental changes.

## Add team members so they can use Notion AI
Finally, its time to add your team members to complete your Notion knowledge base roll-out.

##########################################

In order to use Q&A, youll have to add your teammates as members to your workspace (not guests). Notion makes it easy to add users, depending on the size of your team and needs of your organization. You might:
- Add members via email if you know the email addresses for everyone that will need access to your knowledge base, you can add them manually under Members. This is ideal for smaller teams or to start testing your wiki with your close collaborators.
- Add members via invite link in theSettings & memberstab you can generate an invite link that will automatically add new members when clicked. You could include this in team member onboarding for a no-fuss management system.
- Add members using SSO enterprise plan customers can use SSO to add employees via SCIM. This allows IT administrators to better manage team access and keeps information more secure by automating off-boarding through SCIM.

##########################################

Embracing Notion for your internal knowledge base management will help enhance your team's efficiency and information accessibility. Watch below to learn how it savedRemote.com$485k a year.

## Go further with your AI add-on
When you add Notion AI to your plan, you get access to all of its skills, not just Q&A. This means you can use it to improve writing, simplify tasks, augment daily work, and so much more. Here are just a few ways you might get started:
- Write knowledge base articles faster Simply provide a brief outline or a list of key points, Notion AI can generate a detailed and coherent draft, allowing you to focus on refining and customizing the content.
- Make technical concepts easier to understand As an IT or technical team you could ask Notion AI to re-write confusing documentation in a way that makes it easier for your non-technical stakeholders to understand. This saves you time, and reduces overall confusion for your teammates.
- Draft responses for a customer A thoughtful response can go a long way when solving a users problem. With AI writer, you can draft a few bullet points, and ask Notion AI to create a kind and direct response to their question.
- Summarize meeting notes, and find action items After a meeting, simply ask Notion AI to summarize the key points and highlight any action items. This can be particularly useful for long meetings or when you need to share the outcomes with team members who were not able to attend.

# A user research database to help product teams take action on feedback
Product teams are always on the lookout for ways to improve the product, and often, they find answers by listening to users.
User research provides the context and perspective for everything you do, ensuring you create impactful features and remove points of friction. Its a never-ending process of asking questions, listening, and taking action based on the opinions and experience of the people actually using your product.
Without a system to collect, reference, and execute on what you learn from users, you risk wasting time and resources building the wrong thing, or fixing what isnt broken.

##########################################

Using this Notion database, youll have one place for all your user research, where you can organize it based on your needs, and connect the dots between this research and the projects they impact.
Better databases have arrived!
While the concepts outlined in this guide are still useful, references to specific product actions may be a bit outdated! Databases were redesigned in March 2022, so your experience may differ slightly from whats pictured and described here.This guideoutlines the new database features, including what's changed.
To get started recording user research, you can copy thistemplatestraight into your workspace, and customize it however you like.

##########################################

## Create a database to log your user feedback
To create your user feedback database, make a new page inside yourproduct teams wikiusing the/command. In the menu that appears, chooseTable - Full pageand rename it User Research (you can also add an emoji to make it stand out if you like).
All the information in a database is organized by properties. Database properties allow you to categorize each database entry, and they can be customized based on the needs of that database. This gives you a high-level view of the most important information about each database entry  like the person responsible for the project, the type of project, and its timeline. Learn more aboutall the database properties available in Notion here.

##########################################

Open thePropertiesmenu at the top of the table and clickAdd a propertyto add a new one. When you add a new property, you can rename it and select what type of property you want from the list. Whether you want to know the users location, the length of your interview with them, or the topic discussed, properties help you customize how information in your database is categorized.

##########################################

These are some properties youll want to include in your user research database:
- Name edit theTitleproperty, and call it "Name." This is where you will enter the name of each user.
- Email add anEmailproperty so you can enter the users email address. If you want to send them an email at any time, you can click on the@symbol, and this will open up a new email.
- Phone number add aPhoneproperty where you can type the users phone number, handy for interviews so you're not digging around last minute.
- Interviewer by adding aPersonproperty, you can tag the team member who conducted the interview. This will help you see which team members have conducted the most interviews.
- Date add aDateproperty to enter the date that the conversation took place.
- Product feature use aSelectproperty to identify which feature the feedback refers to, so you can understand at a glance what the conversation is about. You can start typing in the column to create new tags.
- Status add anotherSelectproperty to assign a status to the feedback. Creating tags like Contacted, Scheduled, Completed, or Cancelled will let everyone know whether the interview has taken place.
- Completion time- you could add aNumberproperty to show the duration of the interview.

##########################################

You can add as many properties as you like to capture all the information your product team needs. Each one is totally customizable, so as your team adds features, reaches back out to certain users, or improves processes, these properties can change based on the types of interviews your team is conducting.
## Customize individual pages
Every item in the database opens up to become its own, fully customizable Notion page. Inside this page, you can store details of the user interview, including evidence of bugs, observations from the interviewer, and any action items that need to be taken care of.

##########################################

Just start typing, or hit/to bring up the menu of blocks that you can add to a page. Everything in a Notion page is a block, and we have a full guide toall the different types of blocksyou can choose from. For now, though, here are a few youll find useful:
- Text chooseTextto start writing with plain text. You can type up notes from your interview, including the user feedback and any comments from the interviewer.
- Bullets selectBulleted listto organize your notes in a scannable format.
- Checklist use aTo-do listto list out any action items, or make sure certain questions were asked.
- Headings add h1s, h2s, and h3s to separate the different sections of your page.
- Media selectImageto embed screenshots, orVideoto include a screen recording of a bug or issue. You can also drag media from your desktop and drop it onto the page.

##########################################

No matter the type of interview your team is doing, Notion pages are a blank canvas to capture everything that comes out of these interviews. And because databases are comprised of pages, youre able to both organize your work and do the work in one place. No need to jump around between different pieces of software to check your notes, find a users email, or see the bug they experienced. In Notion, all your teams most vital information lives in one place.

##########################################

## Templates to speed up and standardize your work
Documenting your user research thoroughly is essential, but the process can take time. Coming up with questions. Sending a thank you email. Remembering to remove biases. Starting from scratch for every single interview would bog your team down  and inevitably, things will slip through the cracks.

##########################################

Usingdatabase templates, you can have all this information at the ready for your team with a single click, helping save them time and help them follow specific processes youve put in place. In these templates can be prompts to ask for screenshots of the problem, a reminder to thank the user for their time, and even a list of questions you want to ask in every interview. You can even create different templates for the types of interviews your team does.
As well as cutting down on repetitive work, templates allow product teams to design a uniform process of collecting feedback, meaning you follow the same criteria every time, consider edge cases, and cement your process.

##########################################

To create a template in your User Research database:
- Click on the drop-down next toNewand selectNew template.
- A new page will open, and youll see that you are editing a template. Give your template a name, something likeUser Session.
- You can customize the page content and add anything that you want to automatically populate every time. These might be some headers, likeUser Comments,Interviewer Observations, andAction Items. Under the headers, add some bullets or a to-do list.
- When you close the page, your template will be saved. Whenever you go to that drop-down, you can select your template and create a new entry in the database based on the format you created.

##########################################

You can create multiple templates, perhaps for different types of users, or categories like general feedback or reporting a problem.
These templates can even be updated when you or your team learns better questions or processes from interviews. Simply edit the template, and your team can take these learnings forward with every interview they have in the future. It also helps new teammates contribute from the start  everything they need to conduct an interview is right in the template.
## View information in different ways
Notion databases can havedifferent views, meaning that the same information can be sliced several different ways.

##########################################

Want to see a calendar of all your interviews? How about the number of interviews each of your PMs did this week? Maybe you want to see interviews by the feature explored? Database views allow you to quickly pull up that information whenever you need it.

##########################################

In your user research database, here are some ways you might use different views:
- A calendar to keep track of interviews seeing your interviews plotted on the calendar will make sure you never miss one. To add a calendar view, go toAdd a viewin the views dropdown. SelectCalendar. Database entries will appear on the date the interview is scheduled for or took place.
- A board organized by status group entries by status using a board view. You can create another view in the same way as before, this time selectingBoard. In theGroup byoption, make sureStatusis selected. You can add statuses like Contacted, Scheduled, and Completed, and drag and drop from one status to the next. This helps you differentiate between interviews that are scheduled, those that have gone ahead, and ones youre still waiting for a response on.
- Organize interviews by task create a board view of your database that sorts interviews by what you spoke to the user about. To do this, go to the dropdown at the top left and clickAdd a view. Type to rename it By task and then hitCreate. When you go toGroup byand chooseTask, your user feedback will be categorized based on tasks they relate to.

##########################################

Database views help managers surface the information they need in an instant. Product managers can even create custom views for just themselves, for example, to see the interviews theyre doing this week. Whatever info you need to pull up, database views are the way to go.
## The voice of your users drives projects forward
User research helps everyone understand why their projects matter. Product teams, designers, and engineers can trace their work back to real user needs, helping everyone get aligned behind the ultimate goal: to build a product users love.
Notion lets you build bridges between information across different databases usingrelation properties.

##########################################

By linking your user research database to your projects database, youll provide team members with the tangible feedback and context behind every project. Engineers can link their product roadmap to the user research database and see what users think about a feature, and designers can view the user feedback that sparked certain design decisions.

##########################################

Heres how to create a relation between your user research and projects database:
- Add a new property to your user research database, and this time pickRelationfrom the advanced property menu.
- Youll be prompted to select the database you want this one to relate to. From the dropdown, choose your projects database, and clickCreate relation.
- Youll see that a new column has appeared in your database, and you can rename thisProjects.
When you click in the projects column, youll be able to select any entry from your projects database. This means you can link any piece of user feedback to an ongoing project. Likewise, when youre in your projects database, youll be able to see user feedback that relates to each project.

##########################################

This gives your team (and any team using this database) helpful context for features, updates, or new products.

# Using database templates to help cement your team's process
1:1 meeting notes, project specs, reporting product bugs  your team likely has recurring tasks or documentation. But creating each of these from scratch, every time, can be time-consuming and inefficient.
In Notion, database templates help you quickly spin up pages for these recurring workflows, ready to go with frameworks customized to each project. Not only for speed, database templates also give you the opportunity to solidify a process for your team  like making sure there's action items from every meeting, or each bug reported has a screenshot.
Here, well look at how you can use database templates to streamline tasks and create more clear-cut procedures for execution.

##########################################

## What are database templates?
Database templates are pages unique to your database that you can use over and over again. Your meeting notes database can have a set of templates for different types of meetings (1:1s, stand-ups), or your tasks database can have templates unique to each type of task (bug fixes, project specs).
Imagine starting a meeting with sections for an agenda, updates, discussion notes, meeting participants, and action items already set up and ready for your team to add to. Or, when reporting a bug, there's a section in the template to reproduce that bug, so the engineering team can fix it without requiring a back-and-forth to get it done.

##########################################

Database templates create structure that your team (or cross-functional teams) follows. Along with making information standardized and actionable, they ensure:
- Projects start off on the right foot.
- Edge cases are considered.
- Your team has clear guidelines and standards.
- Teammates can get and up running on a new project in minutes.
- Your team is sharing learnings by updating templates.
Before we go any further, its helpful to know the difference between templates and database templates. Database templates live in any database within your teams workspace.

##########################################

These are different from the templates you may have seen and duplicated from ourTemplate Gallery customizable pages you can use as a starting point for many of the pages in your workspace.
In this guide, well be focusing on the templates that only exist in databases.
## How to make database templates
You can create database templates two ways:
1. Click the arrow next to the blueNewbutton at the top right of any database. Select+ New Template.
2. When creating a new page in a database, you'll also see the+ New templateoption in the body of the new page.
Templates in a database are only available in the specific database where you made and saved them.

##########################################

## How to customize your database templates
By spending time upfront building out templates, you can get hours back in the long run. Since each database template is customizable to the work at hand, here's some ways you can mold them to your needs:
Properties set default properties that auto-populate when using a specific template. For example, if someones reporting a bug, make sure its always categorized as a bug whenever the template is used. Or, if you have an engineer always responsible for bugs, you can make sure theyre automatically tagged in aPersonproperty every time that template is used.

##########################################

Headers establish a consistent experience to make skimming and finding the right information on a page easier. Lets say youre putting together a template so that anyone from marketing to HR can report product bugs. Consider having larger headers covering the bug description, supporting links, and screenshots illustrating the issue. Think of headers like sections of your template your team will need to fill out.
Prompts under headers while youve got headers to help separate your information, underneath those headers you can include some context for what to include. Change the color to gray or italicize the text as a way to signal that its meant to be replaced.

Linked databases this one is great for meeting notes, specifically. Include a linked database of projects launching that week or your teams goals right at the top of your meeting notes to keep everything in perspective and teammates aligned.
When you create a template, you can use it again and again. Keep in mind also updating templates is always possible  and likely will happen collaborating with your team.

##########################################

For example, a designer may pose a great question during a user research interview. Then you decide to add their question to the template, ensuring its asked in all future sessions. Select the dropdown on the right of the blueNewbutton from the top right of your database. You'll see a list of all database templates. Tap theicon to the right of the template you want to edit. ClickEdit. Then make any desired changes in the editing view that pops up, so learnings from anyone are carried forward for your team.

## Where to use database templates
If youre using a database for any work thats similar or recurring, database templates can help you speed up the creation of database entries and ensure processes are being followed.
Here a few ideas you can use as a springboard to build out templates for some of your foundational databases:
Meetings from weekly syncs to 1:1s, your team likely has a format for each of these meetings you can document in Notion. A 1:1 template might have sections for feedback. A standup might have sections for updates. Both might have places for action items. Using templates, you can customize each one so that it meets the needs of that meeting.

##########################################

If you havent started your own meetings database yet, duplicate ourmeetings notes templateinto your teams workspace. Then use the daily standup, ad hoc meeting, and other templates pre-baked inside.
Tasks your product or engineering team likely has many small tasks on a daily basis, whether its updating snippets of code or swapping out visuals on your marketing site. Use database templates for the recurring tasks your team executes, and make sure that each has its own property that auto-populates as part of that template. That way, they can spend time solving problems instead of making sure all the elements are there to solve problems in the first place.

##########################################

Launch a team-wide task database usingthis to-do template. Then use the task database template within it to assign out work.
Docs cut down how long it takes to document process changes or product specs by creating database templates for these recurring responsibilities. Lets say you want your team to have a creative brief template to make sure all the information is available for a designer to knock it out of the park. Yourcreative brief templatecan request anyone that fills out the brief include goals, target audience, the defined deliverables, and anything else youd like.

# Using Notion AI to extend your impact
## How does artificial intelligence (AI) work?
Artificial intelligence (AI)refers to human-produced technology that systematically applies large sets of data to an iterative model. This allows it to predict results, generating mathematical or linguistic outputs in response to an input by the user of the AI.
- It finds patterns in a massive set of data, referred to as training data, to create a model
- It then tests its model by asking a question it already knows the answer to, and analyzing how accurate its answer is. The data generated by the AI is referred to as test data
- Over time and with more inputs and test data, it learns and iterates on the model

# How visual link previews can streamline team collaboration
Think of every project like a wheel. Engineering, product, and design often sit at the hub. Theyre working cross-functionally with other teams, using a mismatched set of tools  which means information lives many places.
And when information is everywhere, it has the ability to be lost, outdated, or flat-out wrong. There needs to be an underlying layer connecting all these teams, tools, and information.
Weve seen technical leaders bring teams together on Notion, from individual projects to wikis and documentation.

##########################################

And now, with link previews  a feature built on Notions API  you can see live updates of information from other tools right inside your Notion pages, even when authentication is required. We recently launched new link previews integrations with Figma, Dropbox, and Microsofts OneDrive & Sharepoint  so whether its the most recent Figma file or a Dropbox asset updated seconds ago, link previews unite teams by giving them access to the information they need to execute.

##########################################

## How to use link previews
Link previews give you the ability to see real-time, synced visualizations of external files right inside your Notion pages. Weve put together ahandy guidethat teaches you the specifics of how to use them, but well summarize here:
- Paste the link from a supported tool in your Notion page.
- Select the format youd like to see the link  a preview, which shows an enlarged visualization, or a mention, which shows up in-line
- Authenticate your account to sync the tool and see live updates. Once youve authenticated your account, everyone who has access to the Notion doc will be able to see the preview  making it easier to share information across teams.

##########################################

After granting access, all your need to do is paste the link once to get ongoing updates from whatever tool youre previewing.
If you paste a link into Notion that does not support link previews, such as with an embedded link, youll need to provide individual access to the file, or for that file to be publicly available for you to see it in Notion.
Learn more about link previews
Click to expand

##########################################

### Why authentication matters
Embeds require individual access to a file, or for that file to be publicly available for you to see it in Notion. For example, previously if you were sharing a Figma file, youd have to share it with specific people in Figma for them to view it in Notion, or make it a public link. Now with link previews, you can authenticate once and easily share authenticated content through Notion.
When you bring a design from Figma into Notion, your teammates can see it without taking up seats on your Figma plan. Similarly, you can control access to that design through theSharesettings of your page, rather than risking it being publicly accessible on the web.

## Visualize your information in one place
Break down the barriers of visual communication by connecting teams with link previews. Whether its a style guide for your brand team or a home base for your project, access to updated assets and information is key.
Too often, as more teammates use Dropbox or OneDrive, it becomes difficult to keep files organized. And if youre working on a project, screenshots just dont do it  they become outdated almost immediately, like a car that loses value after you drive it off the lot.

##########################################

### Here are some ways you can use link previews to make sure your teams have the most updated information they need to execute:
Where to start implementing link previews
- Create a project page as a single source of truth consolidate information by creating a single Notion page for your project. In that page, you can add any visuals as link previews, giving cross-functional teams the ability to provide feedback on the latest mockups and see them all in one place. Sounds better than sending (and re-sending!) countless updates over Slack and email, right?To get even more granular, you can link to a specific node within your Figma design file to share the exact design image you want people to see.
* To get even more granular, you can link to a specific node within your Figma design file to share the exact design image you want people to see.

##########################################

- Share eye-catching slide decks with OneDrive and Sharepoint previews, you can paste a Powerpoint as a preview. Contextualized with the other designs, assets, and words on your page, the deck becomes a lot more valuable to all members of your team.
- Build a wiki that has all your updated assets along with processes and brand guidelines, your design teams wiki might have visual assets, like logos or typography. Add those all as link previews, so nothing is outdated. For example, when the comms team needs a logo to share with press, theyll be able to view the most updated one in your wiki, instead of digging around old files in Dropbox or OneDrive.

##########################################

With link previews, youre getting live updates from designs files, images, docs, screenshots, and more. That makes your information even more valuable because its useable without friction. Instead of searching around files called Logo: use this one! [2021] or Logo: V6 [deprecated], information is simply where you expect it to be. Plus, when link previews live alongside other information in Notion, it becomes a hub for all your work.
## A process that prioritizes collaboration
Design doesnt happen in a vacuum  whether its feedback, new iterations, or important context, there are usually many factors leading to why something was designed the way it was.

##########################################

Lets say your product team is leading a redesign of your app. There are many steps in that process, with feedback being one. Heres how link previews can make that process smoother:
- Keep high-level discussion in one place your designers may have granular discussions about hex codes and margin widths in Figma, but they can come back to Notion to share the 1-2 important takeaways with the group of stakeholders. Keeping the right people informed about the right things, without any information getting lost is the key to moving quickly at scale.
Good comment culture can help your team stay aligned
Click to expand

##########################################

- Add link previews to database templates whenever your design team starts a new project, you can use a template that prompts them to add previews through a database template. This keeps expectations clear, and will help your team to adopt link previews even faster.
- Work with stakeholders where they need to be foundational teams like legal need the robust functionality of OneDrive, while designers need the visual tools in Figma. Create a process that unites them. Link previews brings information from many tools together in one place securely, giving teams a place to collaborate without access and tooling issues.

##########################################

Bringing information under one digital roof in an easily accessible, visible way will help your team to collaborate more efficiently, and reduce the need for endless questioning and searching to find the right files. Link previews are just another way to find the clarity that we all need.

# When to use each type of database view
Databases are one of Notions powerhouse features. They allow teams to store diverse, complex information and customize how they see it.
You have several distinct types of databases  a table, board, calendar, etc.  all of which can be used as different views of a single database. This is helpful when you need to slice a large set of data in many ways. You could have a company-wide roadmap thats a table, and then create different views within that roadmap, like a calendar for your launches, a list of projects for each team, or a timeline for a specific project.

##########################################

With database views, teams can surface the information they need in an instant. Whats more, every entry opens up as its own Notion page, and you can add text, images, files, and much more inside to neatly bundle all project info in one place.
## When to use database views
Teams are able to create different views of the same database, giving them the flexibility and the freedom to view information however best suits them.

##########################################

Heres how you might use database views:
- When you have one large information set used by cross-functional teams  whether its your roadmap or a company-wide list of tasks, different teams can create their own views of the database. That way, engineering can view their tasks without seeing all the marketing work as well.
- If you have sub-teams as part of your team  if you have a table of engineering projects, each sub-team can have their own view, like one for the infrastructure team and one for the backend team. This fosters transparency, because theres visibility into what the entire engineering org is working on, but specific teams can choose to focus on their work.
- Your teams are juggling many projects at once  lets say your marketing team has a master list of everything theyre working on. Some tasks are for the website redesign project. You can create a board of all the tasks related to that project to see their statuses. You can also create a view that's organized by teammate, to see what everyone has on their plate.

##########################################

Theres no limit to how you can display, organize, and resurface your data. Your one database has the capability to be many custom databases, depending on your teams needs. And once you make database views, you can reuse them anytime you need to surface that information.
How to create database views

## Choose a database view that suits your needs
Different teams have different needs  and theres likely a database view to present information in the most effective way for that team.
Heres a breakdown of the types of databases you can use, and which might be most advantageous in a given situation.
### Table
Comprising rows and columns, tables are great for giving you a birds eye view of large data sets.
What is it?

##########################################

- Each row in the table is its own Notion page. This makes storing information for projects or tasks super organized  you can nest infinite sub-pages in these pages, say, for a large project with many parts.
- Each column is a property related to those pages. These might be a launch date, a project owner, or a tag youve assigned the project. You can toggle on the properties you want to see in your table and hide the ones you dont.
- Drag-and-drop rows or columns to organize the table any way youd like.
When should your team use it?

##########################################

- To organize a large set of team- or company-wide projects and tasks. Tables are great for getting a high-level look at information in a glance  like a project owner and its timeline  fostering transparency (you can go into these pages if you want to get granular). Teams can even make custom table views based on their work or specific projects, like a burndown list for a launch.
Learn more abouttables.
### Board
Project managers love the drag-and-drop functionality of board view, allowing you to move pages seamlessly based on their status.
What is it?

##########################################

- Just like any Notion database, each card in the board view is its own page. You can choose whichpropertiesyou display on these pages depending on what you need, like a due date or the project manager.
- Columns in the board view can be three types of properties:Select,Multi-select, orPerson. You can add as many columns as you need.
When should your team use it?

##########################################

- To manage your projects. In a blink, see where all your projects sit. You can customize columns to match your process, like the rounds of editing you might have on a blog post. And you can even keep all the drafts inside those pages, so everything stays organized.
- To see the types of projects your team is working on. UsingSelectorMulti-selectproperties, you can group your board by project type, like seeing all the front-end projects your eng team is working on.
- To see whos working on what. Its easy for certain members of high-velocity teams to get overloaded with projects. Create a board view thats grouped by your PMs to see the projects theyre managing.
Learn more aboutboards.

##########################################

### Timeline
Timeline view helps you visualize the length of projects and get ahead of upcoming deadlines.
What is it?
- A Gantt chart where you can see project scopes. Theres also a table on the left side which you can hide or toggle on to view. You can toggle on whatever properties you want to see on the timeline pages.
- All items need a start and end date to display on the timeline. Commonly, youll use the execution dates for projects, but you can also sort by launch date.
- To extend the length of a project or move it all together, just use drag-and-drop.
When should your team use it?

##########################################

- When planning many tasks related to a large project. You can see all the tasks that are active at any one time, meaning you can distribute them evenly and avoid overload. You can also customize how you see these pages, whether its by hours, days, weeks, months, or quarters.
- It's handy when you want to visualize what your team is working on. Viewing data chronologically helps project managers get the full picture of ongoing work and upcoming deadlines to prioritize accordingly. You can get granular by viewing the day, or zoom out to see the entire quarter. And you can adjust everything on the fly as real-life stuff shifts projects timelines.
Read all abouttimelines.
### Calendar
Great for planning and seeing important dates at once.
What is it?

##########################################

- A calendar where you can plot items by date, and each entry opens up as its own page. To create a new page quickly, hover over the day and hit+. You can choose which properties to display on these pages to help you plan.
- Database items can be dragged from one day to the next to change the date, which will be reflected in your database. Say a launch date changes. When you move it in the calendar, the new launch date will display in your table.
When should your team use it?
- For high-level planning, like all your feature launches for the month or scheduling social media posts.
- Cross-functional or company-wide work, where everyone needs to be informed of whats going on.
Learn about more ways to usecalendars.

##########################################

### List
A minimalist database view best used to collect certain types of pages.
What is it?
- A simple, clean view which shows individual pages in a list.
- You can add properties to help organize your pages, but you dont have to display them all in the list. Toggle on what you want to see, hide what you dont.
When should your team use it?
- List views are great for shared documentation, such asmeetings notes or company-wide documentswhere you dont need a ton of properties to organize them. Your team might have all their meeting notes in a list database, with properties designating the type of meeting and its attendees.
Find out more aboutlists.
### Gallery
Creative thinkers (like design teams!) use gallery view to put visuals front-and-center.
What is it?

##########################################

- An eye-catching way to organize pages visually in a grid where you can showcase images. Weve seen it used for a teams design system or as an inspiration board.
- You can customize galleries a few ways: the size of the pages, which image you want displayed, and which properties you want to see on those pages. Customize everything in thePropertiesmenu.
When should your team use it?
- Galleries are perfect for any visual work, like mood boards and branding materials (fonts, logos, brand colors, etc.).
- HR teams also use them toshowcase new teammates in the employee directoryand display their headshots on the page. This helps remote teams put a face to new names.

A roadmap is a living plan that connects to company goals, documentation, tasks, and more.
Teams using Notion can share one product roadmap that guides them through the product development cycle.
Heres how to create a product roadmap in Notion.
### Create a roadmap database
To create your roadmap, add a new page to your workspace and make it a database. Choose a board layout to see all your projects on a Kanban board.
Notion databases allow you to easily organize large sets of information, assign properties to each entry and filter, group, sort, and resurface information in endless useful ways.

##########################################

Here are some ways to track and organize projects on your roadmap:
- Easily update projects by status Make sure your database has a Status property so you can mark projects as Up Next, In Progress, Done, etc. Customize the property to add as many steps as you need.

##########################################

- Rank items by priority Add a select property to create a priority ranking system. Mark projects as P1, P2, etc. Later, you can Sort the database to view high-priority items first.
- Add project owners and assignees The Person property allows you to tag team members as a manager or engineer working on a project. This ensures team members know what theyre responsible for, and you can track whats on everyones plate.
- Give projects a timeline Use the Date property to add start and end dates to your projects. When you do this, you can also view projects on the timeline database layout.

##########################################

- Categorize projects by type Use the Select property to add different project types to categorize database entries. Tag large initiatives as Epics, and things to fix as Bugs.
### View product roadmap in different ways
You can view information in your roadmap in numerous different ways.
- Filter to focus on a subset of data Add one or several filters to your database to focus on a specific range of data. For example, you can filter to show only high-priority projects that are not marked as Done.

##########################################

- Rearrange items in the database The sort feature allows you to change the order of database items, so you can view projects in order or priority or by start date. You can also Group the content, so, for example, group projects by their project owner to accurately see whos working on what.
- Add different database views In addition to the Board, there are several more database layout options like Table, List, Gallery, and Calendar. You can add additional views to your database with different layouts. Each view can be filtered, grouped, and sorted differently. This means in one page, you can tab through different database views depending on what you need to see.

##########################################

### Work inside your roadmap
Instead of just linking to other tools, you can get work done in the same place where you track your work, which means less context-switching and scattered information.
Each database entry is a fully customizable Notion page.
Once youve added a project to your roadmap and filled up relevant properties, just open the entry to start working right in the page.
You can add any kind of Notion blocks available in the slash/menu - text, checklists, images, video, and embeds from other apps. You can also create sub pages, link to existing pages (such as a Product Requirement Doc), or nest another database in the project page.

##########################################

To standardize your workflow, add database templates to your Roadmap for different types of projects. For example you can create a Project Spec template for a new project that incorporates the elements you need to scope a new project.
## 2. Manage granular engineering tasks
Your roadmap is ideal for bigger projects, but what about the everyday tasks that engineers focus on?
To manage granular work in an engineering task database or scrum board, add another database to manage sprints, assign responsibilities and track issues seamlessly.
Add a Status property, Assignee, and Deadline to your board database. If you want to incorporate sprint tracking, customize your status property to include This Sprint and Next Sprint.

##########################################

Next, connect this database to your Roadmap via a Relation property. This will allow you to link tasks to the projects they correspond to, making it easier to manage and track work towards completing your projects.
When tracking your tasks in Notion, database automations can speed up your workflows.
For example, you can set up automations for status updates and notifications that can edit properties, create pages, and send updates.
So, you could set up a database automation so that when a task moves to Completed, it will update properties on the related Roadmap project, or send notifications to the teams Slack channel.
### Bring work happening elsewhere into Notion
What should you do if your engineers use tools like Jira or Github?

##########################################

In Notion, work happening in specialist tools doesnt need to be inaccessible to the rest of your team.
You can bridge the gap by integrating third-party tools, then add Synced database blocks to create a dynamic database that accurately reflects where work is at, and keeps everyone on your team up to date with the latest updates.
Learn more aboutsynced databases.
## 3. Use customer feedback to inform your work
Having a customer feedback or user research database in Notion can serve a repository for user insights, helping your product team make informed decisions about what to build next.
In your user research database, you can record notes and customer feedback, and categorize insights and customer data with properties.

##########################################

You can also take advantage of Notion AI in your customer feedback to analyze sentiment, get an overview or summary of each piece of feedback, and even extract potential tasks or fixes that are needed based on what your users say.
In the Properties menu, you will see a section of AI Autofill properties.
Here, you can choose Summary, Translation, or Keywords, or alternatively design your own prompt to generate a response, for example, you could ask it to Suggest features to build or fix based on this customer feedback.
This can help give you an at-a-glance view of what customers are saying, help you generate new feature ideas, and make sure youre prioritizing the right jobs in your sprint planning sessions.

##########################################

Connecting feedback directly to product decisions will ensure youre working on the right projects.
## 4. Connect all aspects of product development
Notion brings all your work into a connected workspace, helping teams stay aligned.

##########################################

Starting with a Roadmap, you can build your system to include all aspects of work:
- Give teams the full context behind their daily work Link roadmaps and tasks to customer feedback, so team members dont lose sight of what theyre building. You can outline your product vision on a page to make sure your teams are aligned.
- Track customer feedback Storing user feedback in a Notion database makes it easy to find and act on, ensuring development is driven by customer insights.
- Close feedback loops and reduce context switching Having all aspects of product development from start to finish helps projects stay on track and reduce time wasted switching between apps.
- Draft docs more efficiently with templates and AI You dont have to start recurring documents like PRDs or tech specs from a blank page every time. Make an outline into a database template, or call up Notion AI to help you draft and edit any kind of document.
- Integrate other tools Notion is an all-in-one tool, but teams who already use specialist tools can integrate their work. From synced databases to embedding Google Docs, Figma files, PDFs, Framer prototypes, Miro boards and more, everyone has full visibility into work happening in other tools.

# HIPAA configuration
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is a US federal law that was enacted in 1996 that requires the protection and confidential handling of protected health information (PHI) by covered entities such as healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their business associates.
This article provides users required product configurations to make their Notion workspace HIPAA compliant.

Note:Notion's Business Associate Agreement (BAA) governs the protection of Personal Health Information (PHI) that is stored in the Notion Service. To be eligible to sign Notions BAA, you must subscribe to our Enterprise Plan.

##########################################

Notion Calendar, any Notion Calendar features, and any Beta Services are not covered by the BAA and therefore may not be used or deployed in a manner that processes protected health information.
To the extent that any language on this page and language found in the BAA conflict at any time, the BAA shall control.

##########################################

## Configuring Notion for HIPAA
Table: [[HIPAA Technical Safeguard Requirements,Notion's Supporting Configurations,]
[Access ControlImplement technical policies and procedures for electronic information systems that maintain electronic protected health information to allow access only to those persons or software programs that have been granted access rights.,Notions SAML SSO is built upon the SAML 2.0 standard, connecting your Identity Provider (IdP) and workspace(s) for an easier, more secure login experience. Notion supports official configurations for SAML SSO with: Azure, Google, Gusto, Okta, OneLogin, and Rippling.To get started using SAML SSO with Notion, you'll need to complete the following steps:Verify domain(s):To use advanced security features, you must verify ownership of your email domain. This is an automated process that involves adding a TXT record onto your domains DNS to verify your ownership of it.Enable SAML SSO:This will toggle the feature on and complete the configuration. For more information on completing the SAML SSO configuration, please refer tothis article.Change default login method:Once SAML SSO is enabled for the first time, the default login method will be set toAny method, meaning that users have the option of logging in via SAML or their normal login method. By setting this toOnly SAML SSO, this enforces SAML as the login method for your workspace for managed users with verified company emails.Link additional workspaces:If you have more than one workspace youd like to configure with SSO, you can do so by reaching out to[emailprotected].Once properly configured, any members signing into your workspace(s) will need to use the verified domain and will need to be authenticated through your identity provider. Enterprise workspace owners are able to bypass by using an alternative login method in case theres an IdP/SAML SSO failure.,]
[Unique User IdentificationAssign a unique name and/or number for identifying and tracking user identity.,Notion has a SCIM API which can be used to provision, manage, and de-provision members and groups. Workspace owners can find the required API key by going toSettingsSecurity & identitySCIM Configurationand clicking to view the token.Please seeour SCIM documentationfor the latest information on how you can interact with Notions SCIM API. Notion supports official SCIM applications with Google, Gusto, Okta, OneLogin, and Rippling.,]
[Emergency Access ProcedureEstablish (and implement as needed) procedures for obtaining necessary electronic protected health information during an emergency.,Content search provides Enterprise workspace owners with visibility into workspace content to improve governance of the workspace and resolve page access issues. Content search allows you to: View who has access to a page Modify the permissions of a page Discover and re-assign abandoned pages from former employeesYou can export a Notion page, database, or entire workspace at any time.For Notion Mail, enableHIPAA compliance with Google Workspace.,]
[Automatic LogoffImplement electronic procedures that terminate an electronic session after a predetermined time of inactivity.,Set custom session duration:For managed users on the Enterprise Plan, Notion has a default session duration of 180 days. However, workspace owners can customize their session duration from 1 hour to 180 days.Force logout managed users:Force logout for individual users or for all workspace users at once.Force password reset:Force password reset for individual users or for all workspace users at once.If you de-provision a user via SCIM, they will be removed from the workspace and their session will be terminated.,]
[Audit ControlsImplement hardware, software, and/or procedural mechanisms that record and examine activity in information systems that contain or use electronic protected health information.,Enterprise workspace owners have access to an Audit Log viaSettings. This gives an overview of a large range of events that have occurred in the workspace.This can be especially helpful for identifying potential security issues, investigating suspicious behavior, and troubleshooting access. The workspace audit log can be exported in CSV format.Enterprise customers can also utilize ourData Loss Prevention (DLP) partner integrationsto discover, classify, and protect sensitive data in Notion.For Notion Mail, enableHIPAA compliance with Google Workspace.,]
[Integrity ControlsImplement policies and procedures to protect electronic protected health information from improper alteration or destruction.Implement electronic mechanisms to corroborate that electronic protected health information has not been altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner.Implement security measures to ensure that electronically transmitted electronic protected health information is not improperly modified without detection until disposed of.,Disable public page sharing:This will disable the Share to web option in the Share menu on every page in this workspace.Disable guests:This prevents anyone from inviting people outside the workspace to any page. You dont need to use this control if youd like to invite guests as needed, but note that Notion may not be used to communicate with patients, plan members, or their families and employers. If you need to enable guests, we recommend turning onguest requests. This implements an approval process so that you can have guests in your workspace while ensuring HIPAA compliance.Disable moving or duplicating pages to other workspaces:This prevents anyone from moving or duplicating pages to other workspaces via the Move To or Duplicate action.Disable export:This prevents anyone from exporting as Markdown, CSV, or PDF.Disable workspace creation:This prevents anyone from creating new workspace(s) without approval.Disable or allowlist third party extensions:This prevents anyone from adding non-approved 3rd party extensions to your Notion workspace.Disable external workspace access:This prevents managed users from joining or accessing external workspace outside of your organization.For Notion Mail, enableHIPAA compliance with Google Workspace.,]
[Person or Entity AuthenticationImplement procedures to verify that a person or entity seeking access to electronic protected health information is the one claimed.,Disable profile changes:This prevents managed users from changing their own profile information to avoid impersonations.Domain management:Domain refers to the email address domain associated with a Notion account. Domain verification allows workspace owners to claim ownership over a domain, which will unlock domain management settings.Disable guests:This prevents anyone from inviting people outside the workspace to any page. You dont need to use this control if youd like to invite guests as needed, but note that Notion may not be used to communicate with patients, plan members, or their families and employers. If you need to enable guests, we recommend turning onguest requests. This implements an approval process so that you can have guests in your workspace while ensuring HIPAA compliance.Suspend or delete a managed user account:Suspend or delete managed user accounts from the user management dashboard.Disable managed user account deletion:Prevent managed users from deleting their accounts on their own.,]
[Data Retention & DisposalImplement policies and procedures to address the final disposition of electronic PHI and/or the hardware or electronic media on which it is stored.,Custom data retention settingsallow Enterprise workspace owners to have control over when users pages are deleted from Trash, and how long they can be retained for afterwards.We keep backups of our database, which allows us to restore a snapshot of your content in the past 30 days if you need it.For Notion Mail, enableHIPAA compliance with Google Workspace.,]
[Transmission SecurityImplement technical security measures to guard against unauthorizedaccess to electronic protected health information that is being transmitted over an electronic communications network.Implement a mechanism to encrypt electronic protected health information whenever deemed appropriate.,Encryption at rest:Customer data is encrypted at rest using AES-256. Customer data is encrypted when on Notions internal networks, at rest in Cloud storage, database tables, and backups.Encryption in transit:Data sent in-transit is encrypted using TLS 1.2 or greater.,]]

# Intro to databases
There are three things that make Notion databases unique:
- Every item is its own page:Every item you enter into your database is a Notion page. Open a database item to add more information in the form of text, images, and more, as you would with any other Notion page!
- You can customize properties:Add properties to contextualize, label, and augment any database item with things like dates, status, and links.Learn more about database properties here 
- You can toggle between multiple views:Your data isn't limited to a table. Visualize the information in a database as a list, calendar, chart, and more whatever makes the information most useful.Learn more about views, filters, and sorts here

##########################################

## A tour of databases
Every full page database has the same menus and sets of options. Here's a quick walkthrough.

##########################################

- Views: Edit and switch between all the differentviewsof your database. Depending on your screen size, you may have to open the dropdown next to your current view to see your other views.
- Add a new view: Add a new view to your database, with its own layout, filters and sorts. Depending on your screen size, you may have to open the dropdown next to your current view and selectAdd view.
- Filter menu:Apply filters based on property values. When you apply a filter to a database, only you can see it to start, but you can save them to the view for your entire shared team if you prefer!
- Sort menu:Sort your data by a property. Like filters, sorts are only visible to you by default, but you can make them visible to your whole team as well.
- Database search:Type in any word, whether it's in the name of a database item or in a property, and your database will only show items that fit that search query.
-  menu:Located at the top right of your database, this allows you to edit your view layout, grouping, properties, and more.

A workspace operates slightly differently if you're using it with a team than if you're using it on your own:
- In personal workspaces, newly created pages will be private by default unless they're explicitly shared.
- Sidebar organization under theTeamspacesection is also viewable by all members. The page arrangement will look the same to everyone, although individuals can toggle different pages open or closed without affecting everyone's view.
- On Notion'sPlus, Business, or EnterprisePlan, there are members and admins with different levels of permission.Learn more about sharing and permissions here

# Integrate Jira
Notions integration with Jira allows you to do a few different things. You can insert Jira links into Notion pages to quickly access or preview them, or you can sync your Jira projects and issues to Notion databases so you can track all of your work in one place. Read on to learn about the different forms of the integration and how you can set them up.
## Set up Jira integration

Note:At this time, Notions Jira integration doesn't support Jira on-prem.

##########################################

- Go toSettingsin your sidebar.
- Click onImportand findJira(for link previews and link mentions).TheJiraintegration is used for link previews and link mentions.You can also selectJira Sync, another integration which syncs Jira projects and issues in Notion.Click herefor more info about Jira Sync.
* TheJiraintegration is used for link previews and link mentions.
* You can also selectJira Sync, another integration which syncs Jira projects and issues in Notion.Click herefor more info about Jira Sync.
- ClickConnectand go through the authentication flow.
## Create link previews

Note:Link previews work with all Jira Software deployment models (Jira Cloud, Jira Data Center, and Jira Server).

##########################################

To preview links from Jira:
- Go toSettingsConnections.
- If youre using Jira Cloud, find theJiratile. If you're using Jira Data Center or Jira Server, find theJira preview (Data center)tile. You might have to scroll down a little to find the data center tile. Then, selectConnectunderneath the tile.
- In the window that appears, select your Jira version. Then, enter your site URL, username, and password and selectAuthenticate.
Once youve authenticated successfully, youll seeJiraorJira preview (Data center)at the top of your connections list. Any Jira link pasted into Notion should automatically appear as a link preview.

##########################################

Alternatively, you can set up link previews directly from a Notion page. To do this:
- In a Notion page, paste a Jira URL.
- In the window that appears, select your Jira version if prompted. Enter your site URL, username, and password and selectAuthenticate.
## Create link mentions

Note:Link mentions work with all Jira Cloud products.

##########################################

- Paste a Jira link into Notion.
- Select Mention in the menu that appears to easily reference a project or issue in your documents.If you havent already connected Jira with Notion, youll be prompted to when you paste your Jira link into Notion. Learn more about link mentions inthis article 
* If you havent already connected Jira with Notion, youll be prompted to when you paste your Jira link into Notion. Learn more about link mentions inthis article
## Jira Sync
The Jira Sync integration connects Jira projects with Notion through the use of an Admin API token (instead of a user token), allowing for a more unified experience.

##########################################

Now you can take full advantage of Notion's features includingautomations,rollups, andNotion AI. Use Notion AI to quickly answer questions about your Jira projects.

Note:
- A workspace owner must set up Jira Sync first, then all members can use it.
- You can create a Jira service account to set up Jira Sync  just make sure the service account has access to any projects you want to sync into Notion beforehand.
- Synced databases work with Jira Cloud products (Jira Software, Jira Product Discovery, Jira Work Management, and Jira Service Management), with support for Jira Server coming soon!

##########################################

Jira Sync displays your Jira projects and issues as Notion projects and issues databases. This setup allows you to see and track multiple projects using a variety of helpfulviews, filters, and sorts.
You can even use identity mapping to connect Jira identities to Notion profiles so that you can see whos responsible for what in synced Notion databases.

Note:Onlyworkspace owners can set up Jira Sync, by using aJira Admin token. After that, any member can utilize the connection.
### Set up Jira Sync
Although any member can create syncs, you'll need to be aworkspace ownerto set up Jira Sync initially.

##########################################

- Go toSettingsin your sidebar ImportJira Sync.You can also paste in a Jira database link or use the slash command/jira sync.If youve previously created a Jira synced database in Notion, open that database and selectImprove your Jira syncat the top.
* You can also paste in a Jira database link or use the slash command/jira sync.
* If youve previously created a Jira synced database in Notion, open that database and selectImprove your Jira syncat the top.
- In the window that appears, selectGet started.
- Enter your Jira admin email, Jira site URL, andAPI token, then selectNext.
### Add a new sync

Note:Members need to authenticate their Jira toadd or remove projects. They can only add projects they have access to in Jira.

##########################################

- Go toSettingsin your sidebar ImportJira Sync.You can also paste in a Jira database link or use the slash command/jira sync.
* You can also paste in a Jira database link or use the slash command/jira sync.
- In the window that appears, selectGet started.
- Select the Jira site you want to sync from.
- SelectCreate a new syncor select any existing sync you might already have in the dropdown menu. If you choose an existing sync, your projects will be added to your existing synced projects and issues databases.
- In the database that opens, youll need to connect your Jira account (unless youre the workspace owner who set up the integration). From here, select the data you want to sync into Notion. FirstSelect projects to sync, thenSelect properties to sync.

##########################################

Repeat the steps above if youd like to set up another Jira sync for another site, teamspace, or workspace. Comments and attachments (up to five files per issue, no larger than 1MB) will also be synced.
You canapply permissionsto the database page to make the synced databases accessible to your collaborators.

Note:Jira synced databases will inherit Notion permissions.Members can access synced databases on any pages they have permission to view.
If a member adds a private Jira project to a Notion page, anyone with Notion page access will see it.

##########################################

### People property in your synced database
Synced databases will include people properties! Now, you can use identity mapping to connect third party JIRA identities to your team's Notion profiles. To do this:
- Confirm you have implemented Jira Cloud.
- Confirm that your name and email address are the same in Notion as they are in Jira.
- Follow the instructionshereto set your visibility toAnyone.
### Edit or delete your synced database
To edit the Jira projects and issue properties that have been synced to your Notion database, selectat the top of your synced database Source.
To delete a Jira synced database, selectat the top of your synced database Delete Table.
## How Jira Sync works

##########################################

### Projects database
Your Jira projects will be synced into a Notion projects database. Your projects will be intelligently mapped to their corresponding Jira issues in a related, synced issues database in Notion. This database will come with pre-populated default database views to help you get started more quickly:
- Active (table view): This view shows the projects youve synced whose status is in progress. In other words, this view doesnt show projects that have already been completed. There are also preset filters for owner and date to make searching easier.
- Timeline view: This view displays project name, status, owner, and completion rate. There are also preset filters for status, owner, and date to make searching easier.
- Board view: This view shows your projects grouped by status (Planning,In Progress). You can customize the statuses that show in the view in themenu. Projects are sorted by descending priority.
- All (table view): This view displays all of your synced projects. There are preset filters for status, owner, and date to make searching easier.

##########################################

### Issues database
Your Jira issues (epic, bug, task, subtask, story) will be synced into a Notion issues database, the equivalent of a Notiontasks database. As with the synced projects database, there will be default database views created for you to help you get started more quickly:
- By Project (table view): This view shows all tasks, grouped by project. There are pre-set filters for status, assignee, date, and project to make searching easier.
- By Epic (table view): This view shows your Jira stories, tasks, and bugs grouped by Epic.
- Board view: This view is grouped by status and sorted by descending priority. The pre-set properties that will be displayed are assignee, project, priority, and sub-tasks,
- All tasks (table view): This view displays all your synced tasks. The pre-set properties that will be displayed are task name, status, assignee, date, priority, tags, and project
- Mine (table view): This view is filtered to only show tasks that are assigned to you. There are pre-set filters for status, date, and project.

##########################################

## Unsupported Jira properties
Jira Sync supports most Jira properties, but not all of them. Here's the list of unsupported Jira properties:
Table: [[Time tracking,Resolution,]
[Security level, progress,]
[Progress,Restrict to,]
[StatusCategory,Rank,]]

While Notion doesn't support certain Jira custom properties, it does support all Jira primitive custom properties, such as string, number, select, person, and date.

##########################################

## Sync duration and limitations
- It should only take a few minutes for the initial sync to complete, but depending on the size of your Jira projects and issues, this could take up to a few hours.
- Some issue fields or properties may not sync, such as rich text in property and nested multi-selects.
- For optimal performance, Jira properties with more than 1,000 values wont be imported.
- Once the initial sync has been set up, updates to properties should be reflected in Notion in real time. If you create new properties, it could take up to 12 hours for those changes to sync.
- You cant manually sync Jira with Notion  syncs happen in response to updates made in Jira.
- At this time, updates from Jira will sync to your Notion database in real time  not the other way around. Any changes you make in your Notion database wont sync to Jira.
- Youll be able to see when Notion lastSynced with Jirawith Notion, in abluebadge at the very top of a database. If instead you see ayellowSync failedorSync stopped, you may have to followthe steps belowto reconnect Jira.
- Make sure you have edit access or full access to a synced database if you want to add or remove projects or properties.
- If youre not seeing updates on the Notion side, try refreshing the page.
- TheWatcherproperty can take up to 12 hours to sync properly.

##########################################

Note:If you delete a property in Jira, the associated database item in your synced database will be deleted too.
## Reconnect your synced database
If your webhook registration has failed, or your project sync has failed, youll seeSync failedat the top of the database. To solve this issue, try the sync again with a different set of projects. You can also ensure that your projects dont have any issues in Jira.
If your Jira token is no longer valid or someone has disconnected Jira from Notion, youll seeSync stoppedat the top of the database. To solve this issue, selectRe-authenticatenext toSync stopped. You must be a workspace owner to complete this process.

##########################################

Once your Jira instance is reconnected with Notion, your projects and issues databases wont be recreated; instead, youll continue to use the projects and issues databases you had before.
## Disconnect Jira
If you want to completely disconnect Jira from Notion:
- Go toSettingsin your sidebar Import.
- Select selectnext to Jira Remove.
## Legacy synced databases
Legacy synced databases look something like this. If you do have a legacy synced database, you can followthe steps aboveto recreate your projects and issues databases in Notion using the new and improved Jira Sync.

# Layouts
Layouts let you customize the way properties are organized in your database pages. With layouts, you can make pages in one database look distinct from pages in another database, depending on their use. For example, pages in your database for weekly marketing reports can be built to look very different from your database for team tasks.
Layouts also help you keep your database pages clean and easy to navigate, especially when youre working with lots of properties. You can bring certain properties to the forefront while keeping others out of sight, all depending on whats most important to you and your team.

##########################################

Note:
- To build a database page layout, you must have at leastCan editaccess to the database.
- A page layout will apply to all pages in the database. Layouts cant be applied only to specific pages or specific views.

# Import from Monday.com
The Monday.com importer helps you bring your all Monday.com boards into Notion.

##########################################

## How Monday.com maps to Notion
- If you import a board thatisnt a task or project board, well import these as regular databases following your original boards structure.
- If you import atask board and related projects, well import the tasks into the task database and create a project in the project database using the task boards name.
- If you import a task board without any related projects, well important the tasks into the task database and create a project in the project database using the task boards name.
- Every teamspace in Notion gets one project and one task database per import, so if you have multiple projects within one teamspace, all of those projects will go into the same database, unless imported in batches. As a workaround, you can import any additional projects into a separate teamspace and move them manually afterwards, or import your account in batches so that you can bring more projects and task databases to the same teamspaces each time.
- The importer will also import all information about task owners and due dates into your Notion database.
- Note that an assignee in Monday.commust be namedOwner,Assignee, orPersonin order for that information to properly appear in Notion as an assignee. Any project or task board should only have one column to indicate an assignee.

##########################################

## Import duration and size
- Imports can take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours depending on size. Youll receive an email notification once your import is complete.
- Theres no limit to how many tasks you can import, but for the best experience, we recommend importing 10,000 tasks per teamspace, per import.

##########################################

## Limitations
- The importer wont import documents. Instead, well display the corresponding Monday.com document link in Notion.
- You can import tasks from multiple workspaces, but youre limited to importing one workspace at a time.
- The import is a one-time event; any future changes you make in Monday.com wont automatically reflect in Notion.
- At this time, you cant preview an import beforehand.
- Some column types from Monday.com wont be supported in the import, including:ButtonsMonday DocsIntegrationsFormulaProgressDependencyTime TrackingWorld ClockRatingsAuto Numbers

Its possible for a file to only be accessible if you have the direct link. If youve visited the file at least once before, you should be able to search that specific file.

##########################################

I connected the wrong Notion workspace. How can I disconnect my Google Drive Workspace from my Notion workspace?
You can edit your connection by opening Notion AI at the bottom of your screen and clicking onConnect Google DriveSettings.
How do the permission settings work?

##########################################

All permissions in a Google document will be respected for individual users and general access types listed below:
- Restricted: Only users who have been directly added to the document will have access
- {Company Name}: Anyone in the company can access the document as long as any user in the workspace has visited the page. In the document, the access level should be set toCan find in search resultsand notMust have link to access, which is the default setting.
- Anyone with link: Anyone in the company can access the documentif they have visited the document at least once.

##########################################

Note:Target audiencesare not supported(for example, 20 individual users added to a target audience namedSales team).Even if a file has been shared with a target audience, itll only be searchable for people who have access to the file directly or via a group.
How long does it take for the integration to complete?
Upon initial connection, it will take the integration approximately 36 hours to sync. Once the integration syncs, you can expect real-time updates to your Google Drive to be reflected in Notion AI on an ongoing basis.
How long does it take for new content to appear?
New content added to Google documents will update every hour and will be available in searches then in Notion AI.
Will all future content or shared/user drives be available?

##########################################

Yes. Anytime your organization sets up up a new shared or user-level drive, it will be synced to Notion AI. You can edit this option in your settings.
Can I edit the connection after set up?
You can edit your connection by opening Notion AI at the bottom of your screen and clicking onConnect Google DriveSettings.
Can I add connect multiple Notion workspaces to my Google Workspace?
Not at this time. The workspace admin will only be able to connect one Notion workspace to one Google Workspace.
Does Notion AI respect Google Drive permissions?

##########################################

Absolutely. Notion AI will honor existing permissions according to our existingNotion AI Security Practices. Users will not be able to generate content or receive responses based on resources they do not have access to. Specific to third party content, Notion AI is handling both private and public content with security in mind, only ingesting content according to the permissions mapping between Google Drive and Notion users.
How do shared drives work?

##########################################

To connect a shared drive to Notion AI:
- The drive must live inside your Google Workspace.
- Shared drives must be included during initial setup.
- At least one owner of the shared driver must be selected among the users and groups.
- At least one user selected in the user groups must be a contributor, content manager, or manager for the shared drive.
We will respect the permission settings of the drive (if the shared drive was directly shared with you) or the file (if the file has been shared directly with you or with a group that you are a part of).
How does Notion store or reference my Google Drive data in its systems?

##########################################

Similar to our core Notion AI product, we store create and store embeddings in a vector database hosted by Turbopuffer, which powers the ability to provide responses to questions that leverage third party content (like in Google Drive). Turbopuffer has been vetted by our security team as well as an external auditor to obtain their SOC2 Type II certification.Learn more about Turbopuffers security here
Which account should I use to initiate the connection for Google Drive in Notion?

##########################################

Whichever account is used to initiate connection will be stored in the Notion system as a customer admin email, and we will use this admin email for future updates, so it's important for customers to provide an email that won't change in terms of permissions or active status so that service isn't impacted when, for example, an admin leaves the company. You can use any service email that has admin privileges to your Google Workspace and will remain the same, like[emailprotected].

# Notion AI security & privacy practices
## What is Notion AI?
Notion offers a suite of AI-powered capabilities, integrated seamlessly across your workspace. Notion AI has the capabilities of multiple AI tools, all in one place. Use it to:
- Get answers from your Notion workspace and connected apps
- Generate docs and edit your writing
- Analyze PDFs and images
- Chat about anything, using AI knowledge from models like GPT-4 and Claude
- Autofill summaries and insights across entire databases
Notion AI appears seamlessly in your workspace but leverages technology from several AI Subprocessors to provide you with the service. Check out ourSubprocessor Pagefor a complete list of our current Subprocessors, and learn more about Notion AIhere
## How does Notion AI work?

##########################################

### Who are Notions Large Language Model Providers?
Notion currently utilizes various large language models (LLMs) hosted by Notion as well as by organizations such as Anthropic and OpenAI. We continuously evaluate LLM providers and their models to provide the highest quality experience to our Notion AI users. Any third parties that process Customer Data will be published in ourSubprocessor Page.
How do I subscribe to new Subprocessor notifications?

##########################################

Customers may sign up to receive notification of new Subprocessors by emailing[emailprotected]with the subject Subscribe to New Subprocessors. Once a customer has signed up to receive new Subprocessor notifications, Notion will provide that customer with notice of any new Subprocessors before authorizing the new Subprocessor to process Customer Data. For additional information, please see ourData Processing Addendum.
### How does Notion AI use content from a workspace?
Notion AI is able to reference content from your workspace through two key phases:
- Generating an embedding (i.e., a semantic representation of the information stored in your workspace).
- Generating responses informed by the content in your workspace.
What are embeddings?

##########################################

Embeddings are numerical representations of text or documents. These representations capture the meaning and context of the text in a multidimensional space, where similar topics have similar numerical representations. By using embeddings, vector search algorithms can efficiently compare and find similarities between different pieces of text or documents. For Notion AI, embeddings are created from workspace content to enable the system to provide accurate and relevant responses to user questions.
Here is an example of an embedding fromOpenAI:
[-0.02541878,-0.0104167685,-0.0015037002,...,-0.004155378,-0.00043069973,-0.01679479]
How are embeddings created?

##########################################

- For each page in your workspace, we generate an embedding by using an OpenAI zero-retention embeddings API.
- Notion receives an embedding for each Notion page and stores it in a vector database (e.g., Turbopuffer). The vector database is a data store optimized for embeddings that enables fast lookup of the most relevant pages given a user request.
How are embeddings protected?

##########################################

Despite embeddings only being a numerical representation of Customer Data, Notion still treats embeddings with the same level of security and privacy considerations as Customer Data. All our Customer Data commitments outlined in our Master Service Agreement (MSA) and Data Processing Agreement (DPA) apply to embeddings. View ourTerms and Privacy Pagefor more information.
We store embeddings with vector databases like Turbopuffer. These vector databases have been vetted by our security team as well as an external auditor to obtain their SOC 2 Type 2 certification.

##########################################

### How are responses generated?
- Notion receives a request from a user.
- The request is passed to LLMs and AI Models. If the request does not require searching the Notion workspace, a response is generated at this point and returned. If the users request requires searching their workspace, LLMs and AI Models generate a search query most relevant for the user request.
- The query is passed to a vector database, where a list of pages is found based on relevance to that query.
- Notion sends the query  and the pages identified by the vector database  to LLMs and AI Models where the pages are refined and ranked by relevance to the query.
- The query, refined list of pages, and ranking of pages are processed by the LLMs and AI Models to generate a response that fulfills the users request.
- Notion processes the output to adhere to the right format and language and displays the output to the user.
## How is my data protected?

##########################################

### Does Notion AI respect existing permissions?
Yes, Notion AI honors existing permissions. The LLMs and AI Models used to generate AI responses for a user cannot see or use any information to which that user does not already have access.
### How is Customer Data protected when sent to AI Subprocessors?
Notion AI is designed to protect your Customer Data and prevent information leaks to other users of the service.

##########################################

Prior to engaging any third-party Subprocessor or vendor, Notion evaluates their privacy, security, and confidentiality practices, and executes an agreement implementing its applicable security, privacy, and legal obligations. All Subprocessors are monitored and reviewed at least annually to ensure continued compliance with Notions security and privacy expectations. This includes reviewing documents such as attestation reports, penetration tests, and other artifacts based on the Subprocessors criticality and other risk factors. As part of the onboarding and ongoing reviews, technology security questionnaires are distributed to vendors and are required to be completed. Significant public security events are also assessed to protect the supply chain attack surface.

##########################################

When we send your Customer Data to third parties, it is encrypted in-transit using TLS 1.2 or greater.
For more information about how Notion processes your data, please refer to ourData Processing Addendum.
### Will my data be used to train any models?
By default, Notion and its AI Subprocessors do not use Customer Data to train any models. We specifically have contractual agreements in place with our AI Subprocessors that prohibit the use of Customer Data to train their models.
Your use of Notion AI does not grant Notion any right or license to your Customer Data to train our machine learning models.

##########################################

### How is Customer Data segregated?
Individual customer accounts are kept separate in our production environment. We do not mix or process data from different customers together during AI processing. This means we do not expose your data to other Notion customers.
### What are the data retention obligations of third-party AI providers?
Notion AISubprocessorshave data retention policies that allow Notion to meetour obligations to customers for the processing of data.

##########################################

When using Notion AI, our LLM providers utilize zero data retention for Enterprise plan workspaces, so no data is stored with LLM providers. For all non-Enterprise plan workspaces, LLM providers only retain Customer Data for 30 days or fewer before deletion. Notion AI is additionally powered by OpenAI's embeddings. OpenAI does not retain any Customer Data through their embeddings service.
Embeddings stored in vector databases are deleted within 60 days from when the page or workspace is deleted.

##########################################

If a user deletes a Notion page or Notion workspace, we can restore the content within 30 days. After 30 days, the data is deleted and unrecoverable. This includes any AI-generated data and embeddings. For more information about deleting or restoring your data, please refer tothis article.
### What compliance standards does Notion AI meet?
Notion AI is included in the scope of Notions SOC 2 Type 2 report and ISO 27001 certification, demonstrating our commitment to various regulatory and industry standards.
Notion AI enables HIPAA compliance by utilizing LLM providers zero-retention APIs and allows for the processing of protected health information (PHI).
## What controls can be added?

##########################################

### Can data loss prevention (DLP) be configured to alert for data being used by Notion AI?
Customers can trigger data loss prevention (DLP) alerts for sensitive content in their Notion workspace using third-party integration partners on our Enterprise Plan. That will include content in an AI prompt and the content generated by AI. Learn more about our DLP integrationshere.
## What are the legal considerations?
### Are there rules against what I can do with Notion AI?
TheNotion AI Supplementary Termsapply to your usage of Notion AI. In addition, NotionsContent & Use Policyapplies to any content on Notion, including content generated by Notion AI. Violating these terms can result in removal of your content or suspension of access to your workspace.

##########################################

### Who owns the rights to content generated by Notion AI?
Notion does not claim ownership of your input or the generated output. This is addressed in theNotion AI Supplementary Termsin the "Input and Output" section:
You may provide input to be processed by Notion AI (Input), and receive output generated and returned by Notion AI based on the Input (Output). When you use Notion AI, Input and Output are your Customer Data.
You can also reference our standarddata protection practices.

# Notion Calendar conferencing integrations & API

Did you know you can use Notion Calendar with Notion?Learn more here
## Conferencing integrations

For the best experience with setting up conferencing integrations and adding conferencing links to events, use Notion Calendar on desktop or web.

##########################################

Notion Calendar integrates with conferencing tools like Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and many more. There are three types of conferencing integrations in Notion Calendar:
- Default integrations: Conferencing that is available to you by default from your calendar provider. Google Meet, which is linked to Google Calendar, is one example.
- Connected integrations: An integration you can set up by logging into a conferencing tool. New events you create on desktop or web will generate new links for this conference tool from within Notion Calendar. Zoom is an example of a connected integration that Notion Calendar supports.
- Custom integrations: You can add a stable conferencing link for a conferencing tool of your choice by going toSettingsConferencingConferencing providersAdd. You can give your integration a name. This conferencing tool will show up in the conferencing dropdown when you create events. Any stable links will work, but Notion Calendar can detect popular services, includingAround,BlueJeans,Doxy.me,Microsoft Teams,Skype,Webex, andWhereby.

##########################################

Note:If an event contains conferencing links in both its description and conferencing field, youll be taken to the link from the events description when you join a meeting from Notion Calendar.
### Set a default conferencing option
A default conferencing option allows you to automatically add conferencing to an event that has at least one other participant when youre using Notion Calendar on desktop. To set Zoom as this default option, go toSettingsConferencingDefault conferencing, then in the dropdown, selectZoom.
### Zoom
Connect your Zoom account

##########################################

To connect your Zoom and Notion Calendar accounts, go toSettingsConferencing. FindZoomand selectConfigure. When youre redirected to your browser, make sure youre logged in with the right Zoom account, then selectAuthorizeto give Notion Calendar access.
Notion Calendar asks only for theZoom permissionsthat we absolutely need to make sure the integration with Notion Calendar works properly. These permissions are only used to allow you to connect your account and add Zoom meetings to events.Learn more about our security practices here
Passcode settings

##########################################

If youve enabled the use of Personal Meeting IDs (PMIs) in yourZoom Profile Settings, Notion Calendar will use your configured stable PMI and passcode when adding a Zoom link to a meeting. If this setting is off in Zoom, Notion Calendar will protect your Zoom calls with a secure, one-time PIN and include it in the meeting for you and participants to join with a single click. Notion Calendar generates these PINs according to your Zoom admin'spasscode complexity requirements.
Disconnect your Zoom account
To stop using your Zoom account with Notion Calendar, go toSettingsConferencing. Find Zoom and selectDisconnect.

##########################################

If you remove Notion Calendar from your installed apps in Zoom App Marketplace, we will follow Zoom'sdeauthorization and data complianceguidelines.

Note:
- If youre having trouble authorizing Notion Calendar as you set up the integration, have an admin sign intomarketplace.zoom.us, search for Notion Calendar, and turn onPre-approve.
- Currently, when you join a meeting in the Zoom app from Notion Calendar, your video will be turned off by default.
- If you have any problems joining a meeting, try disconnecting then reconnecting your Zoom account.

##########################################

### Google Meet
Because Notion Calendar is already connected to your Google account, you dont need to do anything else to add Google Meet links to your meetings! Even if youve connected multiple Google accounts to Notion Calendar, Notion Calendar will make sure youre joining meetings across your various calendars from the right Google account.

Note:If you dont see Google Meet as a conferencing option in Notion Calendar, it might mean your Google Workspace doesnt have Google Meet enabled. Reach out to an admin toturn on Meet video calling.

##########################################

# Optimize database load times & performance
Were always working to improve your experience with Notion, and we appreciate your feedback and patience. If your databases arent feeling very fast when you use them, there are a few reasons why this might be happening, and a few ways you can make improvements.
## Things that can slow your database down
- Number of pages: If your database has a ton of pages, it might be slower to load.
- Number of properties: The more visible properties your database has, the longer it might take to load.
- Complex sorts and filters: If your database has a sort or filter on properties like title, text, formula, or rollup, the logic behind it can make load times longer.
## Things you can do to speed up your database setup

##########################################

### Avoid building too many databases into high-traffic pages
If you have a large workspace, avoid having lots ofinline databases, like dashboards, in high-traffic pages. The more simultaneously viewed databases, the more stress on your setup.
Try housing each database in its own page first. Once youve done that, if youd like all of the databases to be displayed in one page, you can:
- Type/linkedin that page and selectLinked view of a databaseto create alinked database.
- Create database views in this linked database and configure them to point to your desired source databases. Different database views can point to different source databases!

##########################################

When using a single linked database, only one database view is open at a time, and therefore only that one database is listening for updates. You should see an improvement in performance with this setup.
### Avoid complex reference chains
Formulas and rollups are extremely powerful, but the more complex they are, the slower your database may be. For example, a formula that depends on several other formulas that each depend on rollups may take longer to calculate.
### Minimize the number of filters and sorts on formulas and rollups
Databases that arefiltered and sortedonformulaandrollupproperties may take a bit longer to load.

##########################################

### Filter on simple properties
Adding filters based on simple properties such as select, multi-select, status, number, and date may improve the speed of your database. Even if you have complex filters, this may help by reducing the number of pages that need to be processed.
### Hide unnecessary properties
If some properties are less important in your database view, hiding them may improve responsiveness and interactivity.
### Delete any unused pages
We suggest removing any unnecessary or duplicative pages from your database to keep it as simple and up-to-date as possible. If thats not an option for you, adding a filter on theCreated timeproperty to filter out old pages may significantly improve performance for very large databases.

## GDPR
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a comprehensive data protection law that governs the collection of and use of personal data of EU residents, and that allows data subjects to exercise control over their data.
As the GDPR is widely considered to be the most stringent global privacy standard, we have mapped our privacy program to the GDPR and other global privacy regulations.
### Notion as Processor and Controller
The GDPR and other data protection legislation have two primary classifications related to the collection and processing of personal data: data controller and data processor.

##########################################

A data controller determines the means and purposes for processing personal data, while a data processor is a party that processes data on behalf of the data controller.
Where our customer is a data controller or data processor, Notion is the data processor of personal data that our customer and their users upload to the Notion service. We process any such personal data at our customers direction and on our customers behalf. We conduct this processing in accordance with NotionsData Processing Addendum.

For more information about our technical security measures, please see oursecurity page.
### Transfer Impact Assessment
Notion understands and appreciates the importance of maintaining transfer impact assessments (TIA) as a supplementary measure and as a critical piece of your privacy compliance program.

### Subprocessor List
We work with certain companies and tool systems to provide our services to you. All of these companies have been carefully vetted for best-in-class security and data privacy practices. For more information,please see ourlist of subprocessors.
## Data Governance
Data governance relates to the policies and procedures that dictate how data is procured and used throughout its life cycle. From creation and collection to processing, distribution, storage and deletion.

##########################################

Notions commitment to data governance is key to keeping our users data secure, private, accurate, and accessible.
### Privacy by Design
At Notion, we believe in privacy by design, which means that privacy considerations are built into every aspect of our products and services from the outset. This includes the development of new products, features, and the selection of vendors.
Notion conducts regular training with our personnel to reinforce the concept that Notion needs to think of user privacy at all stages of the development lifecycle.

# Relations & rollups
## What is a database relation?
Let's say you have two databases for your theoretical business
- One that tracks customers
- One that tracks items purchased
You want to know both which customers bought which items, as well as which items were purchased by which customers. This is a job for relations!
- In the two tables above, the columns labeled Items Purchasedand Customersare relation properties, which can be added like any otherdatabase property.
- Here, when you add an item bought into theCustomersdatabase, the customers who bought them automatically appear in the Customerscolumn in theItemsdatabase.

##########################################

### Example use cases
- Connect yourdatabase of restaurantswith yourdatabase of neighborhoodsso you can see which restaurants are in which neighborhoods at a glance.
- Connect yourdatabase of meeting noteswith yourdatabase of clientsto provide quick access to the notes relevant to each client.
- Connect yourdatabase of taskswith yourdatabase of bigger projectsto understand how projects are broken down into tasks, and how tasks contribute to projects.
- Connect yourdatabase of candidateswith yourdatabase of interviewersto keep track of who interviewed whom.
## Create a relation
To relate two databases, you need two databases. So let's assume you've made theCustomersandItemsdatabases above for the purpose of this walkthrough.

##########################################

- Add a new column/property to yourCustomersdatabase and give it a name, likeItems Purchased.
- Search forRelation.
- Then, search for the database you want to create the relation with.
- You'll see a preview of the relation. In this case, we've created a relation from the Customer database to the Items database.
- Click the blueAdd relationbutton to finalize the creation of the new relation property.
- Now when you click in a cell in this relation column, you'll bring up a menu where you can search for and choose items from the other database to add.For example, this is how you can add which clothes each customer bought.To add an item, click the name in the list. To delete an item, hover over and then click thebutton on the right.
* For example, this is how you can add which clothes each customer bought.
* To add an item, click the name in the list. To delete an item, hover over and then click thebutton on the right.

##########################################

Tip:To change the database you're connecting to, re-selectRelationas the property type for that particularly property. You'll be prompted to choose a new database.

## Two-way relations
Relations are created as one-way by default. But you can easily toggle on a corresponding relation in the destination database.
With two-way relations, the edits work both ways! So if you add a customer to theItemsdatabase in the relation column, the change pops up in yourCustomersdatabase.

##########################################

- Follow the above instructions to create a new relation property.
- Click the toggle that saysShow on [name of related database]. In our example, this saysShow on Items DB.
- Give this corresponding relation a name.
- Below, you'll see a preview of the two-way relation. In this case, we've created a relation from the Customer database to the Items database,anda relation from the Items database to the Customer database.
- Click the blueAdd relationbutton to finalize the creation of these two new relation properties.
## View and remove related pages
When you create a relation, you're essentially adding Notion pages stored in one database into the property field of another.

##########################################

- These pages can be opened and edited like any other! Click on the page in the relation column. Then click on it again in the window that pops up.
- You can also remove any related page by hovering over and clicking theat the right.
- You can choose to limit the number of pages that can be included in your relations property  with the option to select1 pageor to haveNo limit.
- If you select the option to limit it to1 page, people using your database will only be able to select 1 page in the relation. This is especially useful for situations where only one page should be related to one another, for example - if only one order number should be associated with each purchase.

##########################################

## Display options for relations
To change how relations are displayed in a database page:
- While in a database page, click on the relation.
- ClickProperty visibilityand selectAlways show,Hide when empty, orAlways hide.

##########################################

### Customize displayed properties for relations
When you set up a relation in your database, you can also choose to display certain properties of linked pages. For example, lets say you have a database of frequently asked questions at your company. Each FAQ has a relation to a page that further explains the answer to the question. You might want people to also be able to see the owner of each page, so they know who to reach out to with more questions. You can set your FAQ database up so that the owner is visible along with the relevant page!

##########################################

To do this:
- Open a page in a database that has a relation property.
- Click the field next to that property to link a page  click.
- In the menu that appears, drag the properties of the related database into or out ofShown in relationorHidden in relation.
- Once youre done, youll see your desired properties appear in the relation field. This will apply to all of the pages in your current database.
## Relate a database to itself
Let's say you want items in the same database to have relationships with each other. For example, you have a tasks database and you want each task to relate to other tasks.

##########################################

- Start off by creating a new relation.
- Then search for and choose the database you're currently working in.
- You'll now see that the database is related toThis database.
Just as with relations between two databases, you can choose to make this a one-way relation or two-way relation.
- To make it a two-way relation, toggle onSeparate properties. You'll see a second property show up.
## Rollups
Rollups help you aggregate data in your databases based on relations. Going back to our customers and items example above, let's say you wanted to know how much each customer spent based on what they bought.

##########################################

- First, create the relation so you know who bought what.
- Add a new column/property and chooseRollupfrom theProperty typemenu. Give it a descriptive name.

##########################################

- Clicking on any cell in the rollup column will bring up a new menu asking you for:The relation property you want to roll up.The property of those related pages you want to roll up.The calculation you want to apply to them.
* The relation property you want to roll up.
* The property of those related pages you want to roll up.
* The calculation you want to apply to them.
- So, for our example, you'd choose to roll up the relation propertyItems Purchasedand thePriceproperty within those pages. Then you'd chooseSumas the calculation.Doing this adds up the prices of each item related to a customer's name, giving you the total dollars they spent in your rollup column.
* Doing this adds up the prices of each item related to a customer's name, giving you the total dollars they spent in your rollup column.

##########################################

### Rollup types
There are different calculations you can apply as a rollup. Here are all of them:
- Show original: This just shows all related pages in the same cell. It's the same as the relation property itself.
- Show unique values: This shows each unique value in the selected property for all related pages.
- Count all: Counts the total number of values in the selected property for all related pages.
- Count values: Counts the number of non-empty values in the selected property for all related pages.
- Count unique values: Counts the number of unique values in the selected property for all related pages.
- Count empty: Counts the number of related pages with an empty value for the property selected. So, if one item a customer bought didn't have a price and that was the property selected, the rollup column would say 1.
- Count not empty: Counts the number of related pages with assigned values for the property you selected.
- Percent empty: Shows the percentage of related pages with no value in the property you selected.
- Percent not empty: Shows the percentage of related pages with a value in the property you selected.

##########################################

These rollup calculations are only available forNumberproperties:
- Sum: Computes the sum of the numeric properties for related pages (like above).
- Average: Computes the average of the numeric properties for related pages.
- Median: Finds the median of the numeric properties for related pages.
- Min: Finds the lowest number in the numeric property for related pages.
- Max: Finds the highest number in the numeric property for related pages.
- Range: Computes the range between the highest and lowest numbers in the numeric property for related pages (Max-Min).

##########################################

These rollup calculations are only available forDateproperties:
- Earliest date: Finds the earliest date/time in the date property for all related pages.
- Latest date: Finds the latest date/time in the date property for all related pages.
- Date range: Computes the span of time between the latest and earliest dates in the date property for related pages.
### Aggregate rollups
In both tables and boards, you can apply calculations to your rollup column to get a sense of sums, ranges, averages, etc. for your entire database.

##########################################

- Let's say you want to find the total money spent by all customers in our example.
- At the bottom of your Customers table, under your rollup column, clickCalculate.
- ChooseSumto add all the values in that column together and get a grand total.

##########################################

# Reminders
When you add a reminder, Notion will send you a notification to draw your attention back to a particular task, event, or page at the date or time you specify. This is helpful for setting due dates and making sure you never forget a thing.
## Create a reminder in a page

Inline reminders turn red when they change to @Today or are past due.

##########################################

### Create a reminder for someone else in a page
You can create reminders for other people in a page (but not in a database). To do this, make sure to mention the persons name in the same block as the reminder, as in@Alyssa @remind next Monday 9am to review this proposal.

## How reminders work
When you set a reminder, you (or the person youre reminding) will be notified at the chosen time in a few ways:
- A red badge will pop up next toInboxat the top of the left sidebar.
- A push notification will be sent in the Notion desktop app.
- A push notification will be sent within five minutes of the reminder time in the Notion mobile app.

- If any billing information connected with the workspace is currently or was previously associated with Russia, theworkspace will be terminated. This is necessary for compliance with sanctions, and updating an accounts billing information will not change the restriction.
- Terminating subscription paymentsfor all plans identified as having any billing information associated with Russia, historical or current.

##########################################

Impacted users will be able to access their workspaces through September 8, 2024. On September 9, 2024, the workspaces will no longer be accessible and users located in Russia will no longer be able to access Notions services.
Impacted users who are no longer in Russia and no longer using billing information associated with Russia may be able to create a new account. Those users will also be able to access other Notion workspaces which do not have billing information associated with Russia. We recommend exporting your data as a precaution.

##########################################

We understand this change may be disruptive. To export your content from your workspace prior to September 9th, 2024, follow the instructionshere.To move or duplicate your content, follow the instructionshere.

# Sales tax
## The basics
- To determine which tax and tax rate is applied to your Notion bill, we use your address. Notion's policy by jurisdiction is outlined in the Jurisdictions section below. If you are located in a jurisdiction not listed below, Notion will not charge you tax unless there is a change to tax law or other requirements that obligates us to do so.
- Notion uses your Tax Registration Number (TRN) to determine if our customer is a business or a consumer. In certain jurisdictions, businesses are tax-exempt. If Notion accepts your TRN and your address provided is in a jurisdiction where businesses are tax-exempt, we will not charge you tax unless there is a change to tax law or other requirements that obligates us to do so.

# SAML SSO

Note:This feature is only available for users on the Business Plan or Enterprise Plan.
## What is SAML SSO?
With SSO, you can streamline user management across systems, and remove the need for end-users to remember and manage multiple passwords by allowing them to sign in at one single access point and enjoy a seamless experience across multiple applications.

Note:Only members can access a workspace via SSO. Guests will need to use another method to log into Notion.
Learn more about members and guests in a Notion workspace
## Setting up SAML SSO for your workspace

##########################################

### Prerequisites for SSO with Notion
To use SSO with Notion:
- Your workspace must be on a Business Plan or Enterprise Plan.
- Your Identity Provider (IdP) must support the SAML 2.0 standard. See instructions for Identity Provider setup for specific appshere 
- A workspace owner must configure SAML SSO for the Notion workspace.
- At least one domain must be verified by a workspace owner.Learn more about domain verification

##########################################

### Enable SAML SSO for a single workspace
To set up SAML SSO for your workspace, a workspace owner can:
- Go toSettingsGeneral.
- In theAllowed email domainssection, remove all email domains.
- Select theIdentitytab inSettings.
- Verify one or more domains.See instructions for domain verification here 
- Toggle onEnable SAML SSOand the SAML SSO Configuration modal will automatically appear and prompt you to complete the set-up.
- The SAML SSO Configuration modal is divided into two parts:TheAssertion Consumer Service (ACS) URLneeds to be entered in your Identity Provider (IdP) portal.TheIdentity Provider Detailsis a field in which you need to provide either an IdP URL or IdP metadata XML.
* TheAssertion Consumer Service (ACS) URLneeds to be entered in your Identity Provider (IdP) portal.
* TheIdentity Provider Detailsis a field in which you need to provide either an IdP URL or IdP metadata XML.

##########################################

## Link additional workspaces to an existing SAML SSO configuration

Note:Linking additional workspaces to a SAML SSO configuration is only possible for customers on the Enterprise Plan. For more information,contact sales
From the workspace where you have verified your domain and enabled SAML SSO, there is aLinked workspacessection listing all of the workspaces associated with your SAML SSO configuration.
Users with a verified email address who have access to the primary workspace or one of the linked workspaces will be able to log in via SAML SSO.Sales-assisted Enterprise customers can add Enterprise workspaces to their SAML SSO configuration or remove them by reaching out to[emailprotected].

##########################################

### Enforce SAML SSO
Once you have completed your configuration of SAML SSO for a single workspace, users will be able to log in via SAML SSO in addition to other log-in methods such as username/password and Google Authentication.
- To ensure users can only log in using SAML SSO and no other method, update theLogin methodtoOnly SAML SSO. Once this happens, workspace users will be logged out and required to log back in using SAML SSO.

##########################################

- SAML SSO will only be enforced for users who use your verified domain and have access to the primary workspace or a linked workspace.
- Guests invited to pages in a Notion workspace cant use SAML SSO to login. Instead, theyll always use their e-mail and password or log in with Google or Apple.
- Workspace owners will always have the option to bypass SAML SSO by using their email and password credentials. This is to allow them to access Notion in the event of IdP/SAML failure. They will be able to log in and disable or update their configuration.
## Just-in-Time (JIT) provisioning
Notion supports Just-in-Time provisioning when using SAML SSO. This allows someone signing in via SAML SSO to join the workspace automatically as a member.

##########################################

To enable Just-in-Time provisioning, go toSettingsIdentityand make sure thatAutomatic account creationis enabled.

Note:We dont recommend enabling Just-in Time provisioning if you are using SCIM. Having an allowed email domain in place allows users on that domain to join the workspace so there could be a mismatch between membership in their Identity Providers and Notion.

- Only people invited: This means only you and people you invite can access your page.
- Anyone at {your workspace} with the link: This means other workspace members can access your page if they have the link.
- Everyone at {your workspace}: This means other workspace members can access your page using search or using the link.

##########################################

To find out if a given teamspace is a default teamspace:
- Selectnext to the name of a teamspace in your sidebar.
- SelectTeamspace settings.
- In theMemberstab, look forPermissions. If you seeDefault, this means that teamspace is a default teamspace.

- SelectInvite.
When you share a page with specific workspace members, the page will appear in theSharedsection of your sidebar. Learn more about sidebar sectionshere

##########################################

### Share with guests

##########################################

Note:
- If youre not able to share a page with a guest, this might be because:Your workspace has reached its guest limit.Your workspace or teamspace has prevented guests from being added to the page.The email domain of the guest youre trying to share the page with is not an allowed email domain for your workspace.
* Your workspace has reached its guest limit.
* Your workspace or teamspace has prevented guests from being added to the page.
* The email domain of the guest youre trying to share the page with is not an allowed email domain for your workspace.
- If youre on an Enterprise plan and the owner has prevented members from inviting guests to pages, then any people you invite to a page will automatically be added as members. Before you selectInvitein the steps above, you can hover over your guests name or email for more information on how that person will be added to the page.

##########################################

Guests are people who arent part of your Notion workspace. This could be a contractor or a client youre working with. Learn more about guestshere

##########################################

## Permission levels
For every person, group, or teamspace you share a page with, you can assign a different permission level. This helps to keep private information private and gives you granular, precise control over your work.

##########################################

Here are the different permission levels in Notion:
- Full access: People with full access to a page can edit any of the content it contains and share the page with anyone they want.
- Can edit: Select this level of access for people who should be able to edit the content on the page, but not share the page with others.
- Can edit content: This permission level is only found ondatabase pages. People with this level of access can create and edit pages within the database, and edit property values for those pages. However, they will not be able to change the structure of the database and its properties, views, sorts, or filters.Learn more about databases here 
- Can comment: Select this level of access for people who should only have the ability to comment on a page. They wont be able to edit or share the content.
- Can view: People with this level of access can read the content on the page, but they wont be able to comment, edit, or share.

##########################################

There are also different actions that people can take in a workspace depending on their role in the workspace. To learn more, readthis article
### Edit permission levels

Note:If someone has requested a change in their permissions on a page you own, youll be able to see, approve, and reject those requests from yourInbox.
To change someones permission level for a specific page:
- SelectShareat the top of the page.
- Open the dropdown next to the name of a person, group, or teamspace with whom the page has been shared.
- Select a permission level.
### Inherited permissions
When you create a subpage inside of a page, that subpage will take on the permissions of its parent page. To change this, go into a subpage and update the permissions there.

##########################################

Teamspace owners can set default permissions for content in their teamspace. This will apply to every new page created in the teamspace, and if you want to change them, youll have to make changes at the page level.
### Permission overrides
Notion respects thebroadest level of accessgiven to a user. For example, let's say you give Member ACan viewpermissions to a page. Then you give everyone in your workspaceFull access, Member A will also get full access because they are member in your workspace.
Additionally, moving a shared page to thePrivatesection of your sidebar will remove everyone else's access on that page.Note:This override will only apply to the parent page  the permissions granted for any subpages will remain the same.

##########################################

If a page is set to be accessible toAnyone with link, note that even those that dont have the direct link may be able to access in certain cases including the following:
- The page is mentioned in or linked from another page shared more broadly.
- The page uses atwo-way relationthat links to another page shared more broadly.
- The page is nested inside another page that has been shared more broadly.
## See who else can access a page
You can tell who else has access to a page because their profile photos can be seen in the bar at the very top of the page.

##########################################

- An avatar appears faded out if that person is not currently looking at the page.
- An avatar appears unfaded if the person is currently on the page.
- Hovering over an avatar will show you the person's name, email, and when they were last on the page.

##########################################

TheSprint boardis where you can track all of the tasks belonging to your current and future sprints, using a few different views:
- Current Sprint: Shows tasks in the current sprint.
- Sprint planning: Shows tasks in the current, next, and last sprint, as well as any tasks not yet assigned to a sprint.
- Backlog: Shows tasks not assigned to a sprint.
TheSprintsdatabase will give you a general view of your current and future sprints. You can open any sprint's page to view the tasks within. You'll also notice aTimelineview, which gives you a more linear look at your sprints.

##########################################

If youve accidentally deleted theCurrent Sprintview and want to recreate it:
- Set up a view in the original task database that youd like to use as yourCurrent Sprintview.
- Selectat the top right Customize {your database's name}SprintsManage sprint from this view.

## Plan a sprint
- In theSprint board, go to theSprint planningview.
- Move any unfinished tasks from your current sprint or from the backlog into the next sprint.

##########################################

## Complete a sprint
To mark a sprint as complete:
- In theSprint board, go to yourCurrentsprint.
- SelectComplete sprint.
- You'll be asked to confirm the dates of your next sprint and what you'd like to do with the incomplete tasks from your current sprint. You can move them to the next sprint, move them to your backlog, or keep them in the current sprint.
- SelectComplete Sprint.

Alternatively, you can seamlessly transition from one sprint to the next by setting sprints to automatically complete.Learn about how to set your sprints to automatically complete and begin below

##########################################

When you complete a sprint:
- The status of yourCurrentsprint will be changed toLast. Whichever sprint was currently assigned toLast, if there is one, will now be set toPast.
- The status of theNextsprint will be changed toCurrent.
- The tasks on the board will reflect the newCurrentsprint.
- TheNextsprint will be created if none exists.

##########################################

## Sprint settings
Customize your sprints to fit your needs. To do this, go to your sprint board and selectCustomize {your database's name}Sprints. From here, you can adjust the following:
- Duration: Choose how many weeks (from one to eight) you want each sprint to run for.
- Start on: Choose which day of the week you want your sprints to begin on. If you change this in the middle of an active sprint, the current sprints dates will change. For example, if your sprints used to run for two weeks starting on Mondays, but you want your sprints to run for two weeks starting on Thursdays, your current sprint will run until two weeks after the upcoming Thursday, so that your next sprint can begin on Thursday as you indicated.
- Incomplete tasks: Choose what will happen to any incomplete tasks from your sprints. You can put them in the next sprint, move them to your backlog, or keep them in their original sprint.
- Automated sprints: Turn this on if you want sprints to complete automatically before the next one is automatically created and started.
- Turn off sprints: Choose this to turn off a sprint. Once you turn sprints off, your sprints database, sprint board, and relations between tasks and sprints will be permanently deleted. If you choose to turn sprints on again, youll start with a brand new database, board, and relations.

##########################################

Note:
- You cant adjust the dates in your sprints database because these dates are either populated based on the settings above, or set when you manually complete a sprint.
- If you need to break your sprint cadence temporarily, like for the holidays, we suggest turning off automatic sprints and waiting until youre ready to resume your normal sprint cadence before starting your next sprint.

# Synced databases
Synced databases allow you to sync data from other platforms as Notion databases. Syncs are continuous but only go one direction, meaning that data changes will need to happen on the original platform in order for updates to appear in Notion.
Platforms include:
- Jiraboards and projects
- GitHubPRs and issues
- Asanaprojects and tasks
- GitLabmerge requests and issues
More apps will be supported in the future!

Learn how you can use Synced Databases to break team silos:
- Synced Databases bridge the gap between different tools

### GitHub
Learn how to set up a synced database for GitHub and what else you can do with our GitHub integrationhere

##########################################

### Asana
To create a synced database for Asana:
- In Asana, open your project and copy the project link. Make sure you're not just copying the link in your browser's URL bar.
- Paste the link into Notion and selectPaste as database.If you haven't already, you will be prompted to sign in and connect Notion with your Asana account.
* If you haven't already, you will be prompted to sign in and connect Notion with your Asana account.
- The synced database will created in atable view, with all Asana properties automatically added.
- The database will begin populating automatically and will continue to sync if you navigate away from the page.

##########################################

Note:Synced databases only go in one direction, meaning that changes will need to happen in the source (Jira, GitHub, Asana) in order for updates to reflect in Notion.
## Adding a new property to a synced database
You can add any Notion property to a synced database. There are two things to know when adding an additional Notion property onto a synced database.
- If a property is deleted on the third-party app (i.e. you delete a task in Jira), the associated synced database row and all properties will be deleted. They will be accessible in the trash to view what was deleted, but cannot be restored.
- If an added Notion property shares a name with any third-party properties (Jira, GitHub, GitLab, or Asana), that property will not sync.

##########################################

### People properties in synced databases
Synced databases will include people properties! Now, you can use identity mapping to connect third party GitHub and JIRA identities to your team's Notion profiles.

# Transfer content from a deprovisioned user
## When can a workspace owner transfer content?
When a user is deleted, deprovisioned, or leaves a workspace, they may leave behind private page content. This feature allows a workspace owner of an Enterprise Plan workspace to transfer this content to another, current user so it is easily recovered.

Note:This process applies on a usersprivate contentafter they have left a workspace. Content shared with a current workspace member willnotbe transferrable.

##########################################

A workspace owner is able to reassign the private content of a user who has recently left the workspace if:
- The user is not currently part of the workspace (they have been deprovisioned).
- The user had private pages.
- The users private pages were not already reassigned to another user.
- The user was part of the workspace fewer than 30 days ago.
- The workspace is on an Enterprise Plan subscription.

##########################################

## Reassign content in Notion settings
- Go toSettingsand click theMemberssection.
- Navigate to theRecently leftusers tab.
- For the user who has been deprovisioned (the recently left user), select the destination where you would like to send the deprovisioned users private pages.
- You will see a confirmation modal; selectTransfer private pagesto continue the private page transfer process.
- All of the deprovisioned user's private pages will appear in the destination users sidebar, nested under a new top-level private page.

Note:A user who has had all their private pages reassigned will no longer be visible in theRecently leftlist.

##########################################

## Reassign content using the Content Transfer API
Enterprise plan workspace owners can use the Content Transfer API to transfer private pages from recently removed workspace members to another member. This API requires the same eligibility criteria mentionedabove.
To use this API, Enterprise Plan workspace owners can:
- Create a new internal integrationwith theTransfer contentcapability.
- Use the following API call for transferring content:
curl -X POST '<https://api.notion.com/v1/users/transfer>' \\
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \\
-H 'Notion-Version: 2022-06-28' \\
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
-d '{ "from_user_id": <from_user_id>,"to_user_id":<to_user_id>}'

##########################################

- Thefrom_user_idrepresents the removed user. If youre using the SCIM webhook, the user_id is included in the payload.
- Theto_user_idrepresents the recipient of the transferred content. You can retrieve this user_id by querying the Notion Public API using thelist users API endpointor using the API provided by your Identity Provider. For instance, Okta provides thelistAppUsers API. TheexternalIDof the appUser is the notion user ID.
curl '<https://api.notion.com/v1/users>' \\\\
-H 'Authorization: Bearer '"$NOTION_API_KEY"'' \\\\
-H "Notion-Version: 2022-06-28"

##########################################

3. The API will return a failure response if the validation fails. Validations can fail if the from user is still in the workspace, or the workspace is not on the Enterprise Plan. If the validation passes, the API will return a success response and start processing the transfer. When the transfer is complete, transferred content should appear in the recipient's private Notion content. The recipient will also receive an inbox and email notification.
## Restore a user's content and access
If a user has left and rejoined a workspace within the last 30 days, workspace owners will be able to restore their private pages, shared pages, group membership, and teamspace membership.

##########################################

To do this, simply add a member back to your workspace and their content and access will be automatically restored once they rejoin.

##########################################

# Move & duplicate content

Note:
- When you move content from one place to another, your content will be duplicated into the destination workspace or account, and the original content will continue to live where it used to.
- In the process of duplicating pages from one place to another, some content or settings in the duplicated page may be broken. This could include links, relations, permissions, page history, and more. We recommend keeping your original content until you're absolutely sure the duplicated content is set up correctly.

##########################################

# Understanding block usage
## What is a block?
In Notion, the pages you create can contain much more than plain text. Every page you create can be composed of many blocks  from lines of text to table rows, images, videos, and more. Every piece of content you add is counted as a new block. Learn more about blockshere
## Block usage
Restrictions on block usage apply to workspaces that are on the Free Plan and have more than one workspace owner.*

##########################################

Table: [[Plan,Workspace size,Block usage,]
[Free,1 workspace owner only,Unlimited,]
[Free,2+ workspace owners*,1,000 blocks per workspace. After this, your workspace will need to upgrade to a paid Notion plan in order to continue creating content.,]
[Plus, Business, Enterprise,1+ workspace owners and/or members,Unlimited,]]
*People added to workspaces on a Free Plan can only join as workspace owners.
We count blocks based on the amount of content created in your workspace since signing up deleting blocks, or emptying the trash, will not reduce your block count.

##########################################

## Upgrade to another plan
If you find yourself approaching 1,000 blocks in your workspace, it might be worth considering an upgrade to a paid plan. Paid plans offer unlimited blocks and additional features for teams collaborating in Notion. Visit ourpricing pagefor more details.

# Views, filters & sorts

##########################################

## Types of database views
There are six different ways to visualize your content within a database. Here's a high level overview of each layout:
- Table:Tables allow you to see your database pages as rows, with every property represented by a column.
- Board:This view groups your items by property. For example, you could use it as a Kanban board to move tasks from one status to another as you make progress on them.
- Timeline:Use your database to plot project milestones on a timeline so you can see when theyre happening and how long theyll take to complete.
- Calendar:Calendar view displays your items based on theirDateproperty.
- List:Lists are a very clean, minimal layout of your database items.
- Gallery:This view is useful for highlighting images. You can edit your gallery to show images contained in theFiles & mediaproperty  otherwise, the gallery will show any content that the database page contains.
- Chart:This view visualizes your database items in a bar, line, or donut chart so you can easily analyze and report on the data.

##########################################

You can also create, share, and gather information usingforms, which are connected to databases.
## Create and switch between views
When you first create a database, you'll need to choose the layout of the default view. After this, you can create a new view by selecting+next to your existing views. Depending on your screen size, you may have to open the dropdown next to your current view and selectAdd view.

# What is a block?
## Everything in Notion is a "block"
When you create your first page in Notion and begin typing, you've started with a text block. But Notion pages can contain a lot more than plain text!
Imagine every piece of content you add to a page  whether it's text, an image, or a table  as a single building block. Every page is a stack of blocks combined however you want.
Here's just one example page with different block types pointed out:

Tip:Hit the/key on your keyboard (or tap the+button above your keyboard if you're on mobile) to see all the different types of content you can add.

## Blocks can transform
Any block in Notion can be turned into any other type of block in order to use, view, or deepen that information in a new way.

##########################################

Try this out by clicking thesymbol and choosingTurn intoto convert your block to something else!
## Blocks can be rearranged
Thebutton can be used to drag and drop existing blocks. This makes it simple to rearrange, reorder, and reshape your thoughts with one motion.

Learn more about block usage inthis article

##########################################

# What is a database?
## Databases are collections of pages
Think of Notion databases as filing cabinets or notebooks. Each database serves as a container, letting you easily organize multiple Notion pages in a single structure. In the screenshot below, every row of the table is a page within the database "Docs."
This gives you a birds' eye view of an entire collection of pages at once. When you need to dive deeper, each page in a database can be opened, revealing its detailed contents.
## Databases are pages themselves
But wait - each database is also a page itself! This is powerful, because it allows you to move and nest databases alongside other content, just like any other page.

##########################################

## Databases have properties
To help you organize all of the pages within a database, properties can be added to contextualize, label, and augment each individual item.
You can then search, filter, and sort by these property values.
## Database views display the same content in different ways
Databases in Notion are not static. The set of pages within each database can be displayed in many different forms, or what we call views.
In addition to table view, the contents of a database can be visualized as a list, board, calendar, gallery, or timeline - whatever makes the information the most useful.

##########################################

# Whos who in a workspace
A Notion workspace can have several types of users or roles:
- Members
- Guests
- Workspace owners
- (Enterprise Plan only) Membership admins
Read on to learn more about each type of user.
## Members
Members are individualsin your company or organization. These could be colleagues at the same organization or people who read, edit, and comment on a lot of the same pages in a workspace.

##########################################

Members can be added to workspaces on the Free Plan at no charge. Workspaces with more than one member will be able to use up to 1,000 blocks in that workspace. If you want unlimited block usage on the Free Plan, youll need to make sure your workspace only contains one person. To do this, you can avoid adding new members, remove existing members, and add any collaborators asguests. You can learn more about thishere
On paid plans, youll pay for each member thats added to the workspace.

##########################################

## Guests
Guests are individualsexternal to your company or organizationwho you invite into your workspace on a page-by-page basis. For example, guests could be:
- People who have a different organization email domain.
- Contractors or interns who are working with you temporarily.
- Clients who you want to provide feedback on your work.
- Friends, family, or mentors that you want to have contribute to or review your work.
### Guest limits
Unlike members,guests are free to invite to your workspace as long as you stay withinyour plans guest limit. If your workspace is above this limit, any new users that you share content with will be automatically added as members and not guests if they have the same organization email domain.

##########################################

To ensure youre adding users as guests and not members, youll need to remove existing guests so youre below your limit, upgrade to a plan with a higher limit, or work with our sales team (for eligible customers).
### Guests vs. members
Guests share many capabilities with members, except:
- They can't be given workspace-wide access. They must be invited to individual pages in order to view them and their sub-pages.
- They can't create new pages outside of the ones they have access to.
- They can't be added to groups of members.
- They can't adjust workspace settings or billing information.
- They can't add new members to your workspace.
- They can't add new integrations to your workspace.

##########################################

## Workspace owners
Workspace owners are admins who can manage workspace settings, delete a workspace, and manage other workspace owners, admins, members, and guests. Every workspace has at least one owner. Members can be turned into workspace owners.
## Membership admins
Membership admin is a role that exists only in the Enterprise Plan. Membership admins can add or remove members from workspaces or groups, but they dont have the ability to change workspace settings. Members in an Enterprise Plan can be turned into membership admins.

##########################################

## Change a user's role
To change a member or guests role in a workspace, a workspace owner or a membership admin can:
- Go toSettingsPeopleorMembers(depending on the plan).
- Go to theMemberstab or theGueststab.

##########################################

Pages that the exporter doesn't have access to, such as private pages of other users, will not be included in the export. Workspace owners on the Enterprise Plan can give themselves and others access to specific pages using content search, so that those pages can be included in future exports. Some content also may not be exported based on teamspace settings.

##########################################

To export your workspace content:
